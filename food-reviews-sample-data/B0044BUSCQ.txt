AG1JWQCP2UKI7	5	handy treat for dieter	0	0	I am on a very restricted diet, and this product - only 150 healthy calories - is something I keep on hand. I blend it with tofu and chill for those times when I need a treat.
A3OCKYJNMQMKBL	5	great for camping!	0	0	Brought this for my baby boy when we went camping this past summer.  It was such a hit with him and all his cousins, good thing I brought extras to share!!
A3SFS8R1T6JJM9	4	Daughter Likes It...	0	0	My daughter likes this product.  It may not be love, but it is edible, at least to her standards.  She is not picky.  She has been an Earth's Best baby since she was 10 weeks old.  I started her on baby food, in addition to her formula, early on.  It just seemed like the right thing to do.  She has been the happiest baby some people have ever met.  When I fed this to her the first time, she ate half a package.  I had a bite and it is pretty good.  I will buy it again, definitely.
AKS603ZGP36C9	5	So good	0	0	This really does look and taste like someone took a slice of pumpkin pie with a light graham-cracker crust and pureed it with a little bit of peach.  My baby likes it.  And unlike most baby foods I wouldn't mind eating it either . . .
A3DJW4XFP0IN2K	5	Please bring this back Amazon	0	0	My son is a fan of this pumpkin and peach pie pouch.  It smells and tastes great.  I was able to purchase the 12 pack box from Amazon before but it's no longer available.  Please bring this back Amazon.  I can't seem to find this at my local Whole Foods.
