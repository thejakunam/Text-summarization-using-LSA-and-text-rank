A1T1YSCDW0PD25	4	Pretty tasty	10	12	"These are good, but some points:<br /><br />* The eggs are smaller than what I expected (.6 oz/17g each egg) - probably because they are ""snack size""<br />* The chocolate tastes a little weak/waxy<br />* Not as good as the Reese's Christmas Trees (which I give a 5 star rating to)<br />* Could easily get smashed or melt in transit<br />* Mine came with a ""best buy"" date of 11/2012<br />* Another reviewer says that the ones they got had chocolate that was white in color - that's not the case for me... no ""white in color"" chocolate here<br />* Contains TBHQ (a preservative)<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: PEANUTS; SUGAR; DEXTROSE; VEGETABLE OIL (COCOA BUTTER, PALM, SHEA, SUNFLOWER AND/OR SAFFLOWER OIL); CHOCOLATE; NONFAT MILK; LACTOSE (MILK); CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF: MILK FAT; SALT; SOY LECITHIN; PGPR, EMULSIFIER; TBHQ (PRESERVATIVE).<br /><br />They still taste very good (but not ""excellent""). So 4 stars overall."
A1EUIA1VSJDFMK	1	Contains PGRP!	5	6	PGPR<br /><br />December 27, 2009<br /><br />tags: a new ingredient, chocolate, cocoa butter, health, hershey's, low end chocolate, messing with my chocolate, nestle, pgpr<br /><br />by crazybengal<br />.<br /><br />Aww.  What a cute little acronym!  So tiny and innocent.  What are you doing in my chocolate, little PGPR?  You wern't there a few years ago.  Let's find out what you are.<br /><br />PGPR is known in the candy industry as polyglycerol polyricinoleate.<br /><br />Wow.  Cool!  Wonder why they put you in my Hershey's chocolate bar.  Could it be because it makes the chocolate better?<br /><br />Of course not.  PGRP is used to replace the expensive cocoa butter that is normally found in chocolate.<br /><br />Well, is it better for you?<br /><br />Of course not.<br /><br />What you need to know:<br /><br />The 1996 study conducted by Andrew Waterhouse of UC Davis which discovered the phenols (potent antioxidants) in chocolate also revealed that these antioxidants come from cocoa butter and the stearic acid it produces. It demonstrated that the phenols prevented LDL cholesterol from building up in arteries. Another study had subjects follow diets in which the majority of fat calories came from either chocolate or butter; only those with the butterfat diet showed an increase in LDL cholesterol.<br /><br />This is why dark chocolate, which usually contains between about 30% and 50% cocoa butter, is touted for its antioxidant properties, and a bar of Hershey's milk chocolate is not. Unfortunately, Hershey's in particular - one of the biggest users of PGPR - has also moved to take advantage of the new healthier perception of dark chocolate. Not only have they begun buying small high-end chocolate producers like Scharffen-Berger and Joseph Schmidt Chocolates, but they have also expanded their dark chocolate line and begun marketing it heavily as a healthy treat. Besides the irony of their simultaneous replacement of antioxidant-filled cocoa butter with PGPR in their cheaper chocolates, they have put corn syrup in many items from the more expensive and supposedly healthy dark chocolate line.<br /><br />This is the kind of behavior that buying PGPR-enhanced chocolate supports. Dishonest; unscrupulous; pulling the wool over consumers' eyes. Read your ingredient listings carefully, and research the unfamiliar, and you can feed your mind as well as your body.
A2UUN5R6JK7U22	5	Love this!	2	2	I love the bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs.  They may be slightly smaller than the individual wrapped Eggs, but still wonderful--and I like the idea of having more in a package!  Great candy!
A3RPTK45IWW9TC	2	Love Reeses, But Not Service	1	1	We love Reeses in our family &lt;they're kind of an obsession>, esp the holiday-themed ones! Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with this particular purchase. The turnaround time with Amazon Prime was wonderful, as always, but every last one of the Reeses Eggs were squishy and had melted in the bag. For Reeses fans such as ourselves, we were very upset. :(
A1XGIDJQOE9TN0	1	Thought we were getting a deal but.....	1	1	Every one of the packages were melted and stuck to the wrappers. We throw most of them away. We purchased these for Easter (obviously) they came just before which was perfect, but when we started putting them in the baskets we noticed the were oddly shaped. We opened a couple and the were all melted. We took a couple of the bags and put them in the freezer, but they had been melted too long and all messed up. They still tasted good but didn't look very appetizing. Live and learn
ACEB83MWVDWLB	4	Great taste but arrived somewhat melted	1	1	You probably already know what these taste like.  They're delicious.  If you don't, allow me a moment to describe it - it's peanut butter covered with a layer of chocolate.  The difference with these and standard Reese's cups is these have a higher peanut butter to chocolate ratio - something I think makes them just right.<br /><br />The only negative I have is that due to shipping they'll arrive a bit melted.  Not a huge ordeal, but something that kind of threw off the whole shipment since they're deformed now.  I've noticed they seem to melt in my hand faster too, but that could just be my imagination or a particular batch.  Putting them in the fridge helps though.<br /><br />As a note these are SNACK SIZE, so they are small, but you get a lot of them so it's ok.
A273WO9U3E7QW0	4	I had no age issues	1	1	After purchasing these I feel badly for the people who said their eggs were stale.  These arrived within two days and were very fresh.  Another good deal Amazon
A1JWTU1JUS2SHN	5	Love these eggs	1	1	I love these eggs. I look forward to easter specifically for these eggs. When i saw the price, i had to jump on it. With free prime 2 day shipping, you can't beat it.
A2ONUP0ACJHEAS	1	Peanut Butter Eggs	1	1	Reese's peanut butter eggs were delivered with chocolate melted.  Amazon should not sell chocolate items unless they can guarantee they will be delivered unmelted!! I will never buy anything with chocolate again!
A3FAIW6AAON5N4	1	In the package it melted, melted,melted,small, small, small	1	1	Amazon should not sell these, if they can't have quick shipping or put insulated bags. I ordered 2 things of these and did not come in enough time. UPS had them for a week and I did call Amazon to see if they could do anything since it is perishable you can't return them. All they did was issue me a $5 credit. That did not cover it so I lost a few dollars too in the process. Being late did not bother me as much since you could eat them later. The fact that there was no extra protection bothered me. After being frozen to see if I could bake or put in ice cream, they taste like plastic cardboard.
A3BGZVMR8DA2I5	4	Not real fresh, not stale. Pretty good. Can one be a PBC connoisseur?	1	1	I love holiday candies because they're predictably fresh (as opposed to the regular versions that have been sitting in a warehouse for 6 months - the holiday packaging ensures they're new stock).  Bought these from amazon for a great price despite mediocre reviews.  The reviews are true - this stuff wasn't handled with care - but the candies are still terrific.  They're visually a little waxy (visual eaters take note!) but the flavor is just a notch or two below ideal freshness and at least two notches above the non-holiday versions typically on my grocer's shelf.  Quite good.<br /><br />If you typically eat the Peanut Butter Cup (PBC) form, you may find the flavor of the holiday versions a little different.  The different shapes of the various holiday versions (bunnies, eggs, Christmas trees, etc.) alter the balance of peanut butter to chocolate in each bite.  There is a small finch-egg size PB egg (PBE) that is harder like the mini-cups.  It's actually interesting to geek out on the flavor differences between all the different shapes.  This oval egg is one of my absolute favorites - higher PB-per-bite balance, but still plenty enough chocolate.  The holiday shape versions are softer (no side ridging like the cups to add rigidity), with a different tooth-feel, and not as easy to transport without smushing.  This is a mini version of the soft PBE, and I found the flavor (PB to chocolate balance) virtually identical to the single-serving full-size PBE.<br /><br />If you happen to enjoy holiday PBEs, these mini-eggs are a sensible serving size without sacrificing the yummy texture and flavor of the larger PBEs.
A11KTAQPV74AJL	5	Rocket Fuel for Hikers	1	1	I like to take these hiking in parks outside.  They are delicious for that mid-hike snack can't be beat.  I would recommend these to anyone who wants a snack and is not too sensitive to sugar.
A1V48JWDOK7ZM1	4	Smaller than expected	1	1	"As others have already said, these are the ""snack size"" though they don't say it anywhere.  In the end, that's probably better, since I can usually keep myself to 1-2 a day and since they're smaller, that's less overall."
A300GMVCM24VLB	4	20 Word Review	2	3	They taste delicious but they could have used safer ingredients.  As a runner, I feel like they slowed me down.
A23O52ZTCP6M1K	5	Reese's peanut butter eggs	0	0	This was a great buy right before Easter.  It is one of my family's favorite candy.  There was a big supply to share with all.  The chocolate was fresh and so was every other ingredient in the candy.  Wish you would do this more often;  not just on special occasions.  Thanks for a special deal.
A2FDIA0BWLFZ5C	1	Penut Butter was very dry, couldn't even finish one!	0	0	These eggs are my favorite & I thought ordering them close to Easter (just a week or so after) they would still be nice & soft. The chocolate is a bit waxy on these anyway, but the peanut butter in these were so dry it was crumbling all over the place when I took a bite. I tried opening another one & it was exactly the same. Disappointing that these can't be returned but understandable.
AJ83PVJN1Y5EK	1	Horrible!!!! Do not buy	0	0	Reese eggs taste great and are one of my favorite candies. But these were a melted mess.  Changes texture and taste. Price was good but not worth it.  Also could not return.  Booooooooooo....
A1MRQDX78XEYV0	2	Not a good way to package them	1	2	This is 4 bags in one big bag.  No air like in potatoe chip bags to keep things from getting smashed.  So, mine got smashed in shipping.  It was 4 bags in a box with some bubble bags and it all just shook around in shipping smashing into each other.<br /><br />The best ones look like peanuts in shells... lots of little dents and some big dents.<br /><br />The worse ones won't even come out of the wrappers due to crushing.  :(  Trapped forever.<br /><br />Can't really use them as is... will just have to give them away at work or something.
A170A0VNV7T64Y	1	Yuck	1	2	Ordered these for an Easter egg hunt. They arrived completely melted and unrecognizable. I was extremely disappointed in this product.
A1IBEDPPRC7YET	1	taste is disappointing	1	2	Not even close to reeses peanut butter cups flavor. Blah, bland & forgettable. Not worth buying even at the amazon discounted price.
A9P7G9LKMJ4MW	1	disatisfied	5	9	was very disapointed with this purchase the expiration date was 2013 but the candy wasn't fresh the milk chocolate was white in color like it was old or had been exposed to warm temperatures opened all 4 bags and they were all the same would not recommend
