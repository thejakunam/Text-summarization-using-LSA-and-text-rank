AEV5ZH0IBZ27D	5	Seems to really work!! I will be ordering more!!	21	21	I've been taking this for about 6 weeks and it really seems to keep me on a even keel.  I've also lost weight on it without really trying.  Will be ordering more soon.  My doctor says if it works to stay with it.  She has done the research on saffron and is really impressed so far.

That's roughly 12 of these pills per day.<br />""Satiereal, a Crocus sativus L. extract, reduces snacking and increases satiety in a randomized placebo-controlled study of mildly overweight, healthy women.""

A2LUSYXY8NXYKW	1	Doesn't cut appetite	1	1	If you're looking to have your appetite cut, this isn't the product.  It's definitely saffron- and I love the smell- but it's a really expensive experiment!!
A3J7TPLM4K2PGD	5	Worth the price	1	1	Once you open the bottle you sense the Saffron aroma, which is a good sign, meaning that it is a quality product made from real Saffron.  I bought my first bottle to test if the product really decreases your appetite and it does.  I take two tablets in the morning and two more during the day and so far it has made a big difference, specially with the sugar cravings that ruined my diet and weight.  I ordered two additional bottles and will update this review once I finish the second bottle.  So far, I highly recommend this product.
