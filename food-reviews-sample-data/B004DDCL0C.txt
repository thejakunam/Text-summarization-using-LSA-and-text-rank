A31E5ZKLUQGSSD	5	bEST GRANOLA BAR EVER ONLY 100 CALS	1	1	Really, only 100 calories yep these are hands down the best calorie bargin out there for any granola bar. They tastel like a candy par =, have 5g of protein and 6 gs of fiber.  I hope everyone buys these so they don't stop making them. I can't find them in stores though.
A1ILGH7RH8Y9CP	4	Tasty, low carb treat	0	0	"These are good!  Especially since being on a low carb/cal diet, my options are limited especially when it comes to food like 'granola'.  The Russel Stover  Cinnamon roll is better, but these are a nice change and treat for when I have my 'afternoon munchies'.<br /><br />I was almost ready to give a 5 star review to offset the  one star review, but decided not to since it wasn't a 5 star product for me.  The one star review is certainly not fair since it wasn't even talking about the quality of the product, but rather what was perceived as false advertising--to me it was perfectly clear. And no where does it state ""list price for ""30 boxes of 5 bars each or 150 bars total"" is 30 x 3.99 = $119.70. and 80 percent off of the list price is $23.94. However amazon ships only 6 boxes of 5 bars. So they are over charging customers by 80 percent"".  What is this person talking about??  This is a good price for these bars-especially with free shipping. Remember review the product NOT the seller!"

So list price for ""30 boxes of 5 bars each or 150 bars total"" is 30 x 3.99 = $119.70. and 80 percent off of the list price is $23.94. However amazon ships only 6 boxes of 5 bars. So they are over charging customers by 80 percent.  DO NOT TRUST amazon."
