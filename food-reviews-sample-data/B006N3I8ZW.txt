A16LCURGMVZ1ZN	5	mmmm good tea	3	3	I am so happy to have found a wonderful decaf tea for myself and guests. This tea is nice and full flavored and has a very smooth finish. I usually use the K-cup twice on xl setting and the tea remains true and delicious. The price is the best i have found anywhere
ASJKKI1EHIYWP	5	Excellent Taste	2	2	Twinings English Breakfast Decaffeinated Tea was exactly what I was looking for.  I loved the English Breakfast tea but needed to find a decaf version.  The taste is great, the price is right, and I'm sold!
A1PZ6V5ML5VK24	5	YUM without the BUZZZZZZZZZZ	1	1	Great tasting tea - in fact, much better then the bags of same. I'm an Decaf Irish Breakfast tea drinker but can't find that in K-Cups.  English Breakfast in K-cups tastes great!!
A1QU5WEF3LS9YD	5	Twinings---a good cup of tea	0	0	I have been drinking Twining's tea for years.  It used to be made in England but now they have a plant in North Carolina for the American trade.  The tea is excellent. I drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea.
