A3KZLIEGCSSM5L	1	NOT TRUE CINNAMON, THIS IS CASSIA	4	4	I am shocked that AMAZON would directly sell a misrepresented product. The picture on the bag is canela en rama (as it is known in Mexico) and true ceylon cinnamon (as it is known in Sri Lanka). What is in the bag however is cassia, the fake cinnamon the FDA has approved for use in the US. I am so disappointed. If you use the cinnamon found at your local grocery store, this is a great deal. But if you know the difference, then you know that the two are NOT interchangeable and THIS WILL NEVER DO! Cassia is hot, harsh and intense while canela/ceylon is rich in flavor but mild and sweet.<br /><br />Ceylon resembles a cigar from the side, many layers and is light brown in color. You can eat straight from the bag. Cassia comes as flatish squares or is a single layer rolled into what resembles binoculars from the side.<br /><br />If you want true mexican/ceylon, use this link or cut and paste into your browser. Amazon now offers the good stuff with Super Saver shipping. I'm glad they made right by my bad experience.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAU1F0?ie=UTF8&force-full-site=1
