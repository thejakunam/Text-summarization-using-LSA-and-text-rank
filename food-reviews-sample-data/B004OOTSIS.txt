A2HTHEM5T76V8L	5	Tasty Gummy Treats!!!	1	1	For someone always looking for halal treats for this kids, this was a great find. My kids were so excited to have gummy bears that they could eat. They really like the taste. As another reviewer stated, the gummy bears are stuck together in the bag but they are very easy to take apart. It is nice to have 12 indvidual serving bags. Very reasonable price for a halal product. I would definitely buy it again.
