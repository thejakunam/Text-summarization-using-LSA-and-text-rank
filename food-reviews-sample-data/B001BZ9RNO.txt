A1JUVNETPIK27K	2	Tastes good but....	2	2	Why the transfats, Betty Crocker, why?  The partially-hyrdogenated oil is a pointless ingredient.  I like how they taste, but will be making my own healthy version at home.
A2Q3VOAXLF8WS3	5	Moist muffins, mmm!	2	2	Yum, the muffins are dark, moist, not too cinnamon-y or overwhelmingly apple--they're just right. It's easy to whip up a batch. They make a great morning muffin or an afternoon snack, definitely a tasty way to get more fiber into your diet. I've even tried them substituting apple sauce for the oil, and they're good that way too. Sometimes I add raisins, currants, or chopped dried apricots, equally good.<br /><br />I first saw these at Costco. Then Costco stopped carrying them except in Montana (I like these, but not THAT much). Costco said this was a special item with a limited run, but it appears that Amazon has cornered the market on this item, which is okay with me.
A8W4ZYLIS1ZAX	5	Hard to Find Item	1	1	This item became hard to find in my local supermarket so I decided to search Amazon and found it easly there.  I sent some to my Grandaughter, in Florida,  who also was not able to find it in her local store.  Both parties are extremely happy now and baking away.  Thank You
A14VDGRAQL4LDL	5	Great Muffins	0	0	I love these muffins and so does my grand daughter. It's something she expects to find at my house. I have diabetes and these muffins don't raise my blood sugar so I can eat them without feeling guilty.  I always have some on hand and eat one or two every day.  I'm so happy that Amazon has them because my local supermarkets have stopped carrying them.
