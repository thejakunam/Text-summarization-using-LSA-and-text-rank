A2TYNJ8KC4XIRG	5	Nothing better compares	1	1	My husband and I were introduced to Pilon when living in Florida 5 years ago. Later when we moved to Colorado we were very disappointed when we couldn't find anyone that sold Pilon coffee. We tried other expresso coffees even Starbucks, but none compared to the quality of Pilon Cafe Expresso. We were so happy when we learned that we could buy it on line and have it delivered to our home.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />d. grubbs
A2OBRBYSY3AW19	5	Excellent Value, Powerful Taste	0	0	The aroma exudes confidence and vivacity, proudly presenting sharp flavors of iron and a hint of chocolate.  It depends on the density of the packing into the espresso filter, but this coffee ranges from the sharpness to a much more mellow, reserved flavor.  A good platform to fine-tune your packing pressure, amount, and water temperature among other things.  Won't disappoint.
A2GYFDPALHTGZI	5	Extremly poor service by the suplier	0	0	I ordered this product from Grestides in NYC, through AMAZON and Iwas told at the time the product would be sent in 24 to 48 hrs. I received the product between 4 to 5 weeks. I live in Norfolk, Va and could have walked to NY and back in 1 week, also there is no way to contact them for the status of your order. NEVER AGAIN FROM AMAZON.
