A1ODOGXEYECQQ8	4	Great tasting cappucino in a convenience can	0	0	"This is cappuccino in an 8.45 oz can, just a bit more than a regular 12 oz soda can. You won't get the, ""You got milk mustache"" or some cute latte art, but you can really taste a nice combination of strong coffee flavor and milk - tastes great. 100 calories.<br /><br />The milk comes from rBST free cows (I first had to Google it to know what it means), meaning no injection with artificial hormones to increase production of milk. RBST is already banned in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, etc., but not in the US yet.<br /><br />Not better than the hot cappuccino served with the traditional atmosphere, but if you need to run, you can just grab one and throw it in you bag.<br /><br />Product of Denmark."
A1UQBFCERIP7VJ	4	illy issimo cappuccino	0	0	Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.
