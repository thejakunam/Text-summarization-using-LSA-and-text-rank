AXC8TDCIET6LC	5	Excellent Product for Those Seeking a Healthier Cracker	4	4	I was a little wary after reading the reviews of this and other Ryvita products about expiration dates or whole boxes that were in pieces rather than whole crackers. I ordered anyways and I am glad I did. Only one box had a few broken crackers, everything else was intact and delicious. I ordered in January and they don't expire until August, which is plenty of time to consume them all.<br /><br />The crackers themselves are crispy and have a ton of whole pumpkin seeds baked right in, which is nice because I was expecting a small amount, like the tiny amount of nuts that are usually in a chocolate bar with nuts. But this was not the case, making the already-low subscribe and save price even better.<br /><br />The crackers are a little on the dry side, so be sure to enjoy them with a glass of your favorite beverage or perhaps a piece of fruit. I like to eat one in the morning with yogurt, which takes care of the dryness. Overall they taste have a slightly nutty and grainy taste and would be great with spreads or cheese.
A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR	5	AWESOME crackers!	4	4	I feel for the reviewer who got pieces and crumbs rather than whole crackers, but I gotta tell ya--these crackers are TERRIFIC.<br /><br />First of all, they are so light. You bite into them, and they just break apart so easily, then remain crunchy as you happily munch away.<br /><br />There's no shortage of pumpkin seeds, and the taste is just right--neither salty nor sweet, perfect for ANY kind of topping (just don't pick anything too heavy; these aren't strong enough for, say a huge pile of meat and cheese).<br /><br />I top mine in a variety of ways:<br /><br />1) with MaraNatha organic no-stir peanut butter and Crofter's organic super fruit spread;<br />2) with goat cheese and bruschetta topping (chopped tomatoes, basil, and onion, with a splash of red wine vinegar and olive oil--and don't let too much liquid get onto the cracker, or it will break); or<br />3) soft cream cheese and chopped olives.<br /><br />Yumscrumarama!<br /><br />(Additional kudos to Ryvita for their fruit crispbread, which  last time I checked was still not available again on Amazon, but which hopefully will be.)
AQ9YFSXP11XQE	5	Best crispbread on the market	4	4	I'm sorry that the other person who reviewed these received them in crumbles.<br />I've tried every crispbread on the market. These are very nutritious and wonderfully flavorful. Delicious.<br />In 2nd place I'd put the sunflower seed ones.
A2LJJ4482V9LAW	3	Good crackers but mine were also stale	3	3	"I like Ryvita and can't stop eating their crackers once I open a box.  However, this order arrived smelling and tasting stale.  I kept them and would toast them and cover with cream cheese, etc.  I think they are a healthier alternative to other crackers.<br /><br />Amazon has a quality issue on many foods, apparently.  They seem to have ""sales"" when items are close to expiring.  This isn't the first time I've had something that was stale nor do I think it will be the last.  Unfortunate.  Just beware."
A35NV6VWEHDPV0	1	Non-Crisp	1	1	"I have expected a Crispbread however the ""Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Pumpkin Seeds & Oats"" is very crumbly and breaks as early as you take it out of the package and certainly when you try to spread anything on it"
ANPAI61AR0AT9	1	Pumpkin Seeds Spoil Quickly...So Did These Crackers	1	1	I bought these crackers when they were marked down on Amazon, but I was extremely disappointed upon opening a box to discover that the crackers were rancid!  The replacement shipment was no better - still spoiled.  I think this is an inherent problem with the pumpkin seeds, as pumpkin seeds apparently spoil very quickly.  When I picked off the pumpkin seeds (embedded in the crackers), the rest of the cracker smelled/tasted fine.  But obviously, I can't do that with all of the crackers, since the pumpkin seeds are really baked in there.  Since I think this is a defect with the product, I can't recommend these crackers.
A1OHWRS44Y8V03	5	RYVITA, Pumpkin Seed & Rye Crispbreads	1	1	A great tasty & healthy product, my entire family eats this product as snacks with dips or butter.
A2POD8Y5A0PONZ	3	Yummy	0	0	Couldn't eat the whole case of ryvitas but gave boxes away.  Delicious and healthy with the added pumpkin seeds.  Great with hummus!
A3NUEGR0HSU0TH	5	Healthy and Flavorful	0	0	"I was diagnosed as insulin resistant, and while it hasn't been too hard to adjust my eating there are two things I couldn't find a substitute for: bread and crackers. I missed my sandwiches and crackers with cheese, but these crispbreads are perfect. I have this flavor as well as the sesame and oat, but I rather the pumpkin seed. They are crunchy and filling and work great to make an open faced ""sandwich"" or with a bit of goat cheese or nut butter spread on them. One slice is all it takes to fill me; for lunch all I need is one with some toppings. I bought these in the store and while my first cracker was broken, the others were not and have not broken on me, though I usually spread cheese on them while they are on a plate and not in my hand. It seems like the mailing system might be a bit too rough for them, but perhaps you can call the company and see if they sell  them in local stores near you."
AA4GC72H2UZQ4	5	Good for almost any meal	0	0	I bought these crispbreads because I decided to start using good quality crackers instead of bread. When I buy bread, it tends to go unused except for a few slices. Yet, sometimes you need something to hold butter, meat, or cheese. These crackers work very well for that; they don't overpower the food and they are tasty.<br /> I did not think the crackers arrived stale. However, they do taste different than crispy, toasted crackers, if that is what you expected. I have bought Ryvita in many different supermarkets and small groceries and they always have this taste. They are thicker than what you might expect, and somewhat bland. They have taste because of the toppings that are baked into them. They are not salty, they are crispy-crunchy. They never are and I don't think they are supposed to be. They are not like saltines. They are not like Ritz crackers.<br />  They are very good, though. They have their own unique taste and texture.
A130IMN3J4RDT1	5	Great flavor and texture	0	0	These are my favorite crackers of this type.  The plenitude of seeds makes them really good.  My grandsons really like these, and they're good for you.
AE4FYJAYPRGCI	5	Return Purchaser	0	0	I've ordered these twice so far from Amazon as they aren't available locally.  Have had a few broken crackers, but not many.  And broken or not, they are still delish.  I smear Laughing Cow Light cheese wedges on them and they are a decadent snack.  I am on Weight Watchers and they are point friendly. There are two boxes left in the cupboard, so I will be reordering soon.
A3QPS6DTQ7OG5P	1	NOT GOOD	0	0	In the package I opened, the crackers were broken.  That wasn't bad enough.  They were also stale!
A3D2J6KW5UKRZU	1	Ryvita	2	4	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDBRI6"">Ryvita Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Pumpkin Seeds & Oats, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a> I have been using this product for 2 years because I am a diabetic.  I cannot find it where I moved to so I placed an order through Amazon.  Never have I had a problem with anything I ordered through Amazon.  This product arrived in crumbs. I have opened two boxes and both are broken pieces.  The others sound broken when I shake them but I cannot open them because of staleness issue.  I would like to cancel my delivery of every two months because of this."
