A2TH8PVFE0MPW6	5	great on-the-go fruits alternatives	0	0	As youth fitness trainer I meet many kids. Not all of them like fresh fruits, almost all of them dislike at least some fruits. All of them like Gorge Delights JustFruit bars.<br />These bars are made from fruit concentrates only; with no added sugar and no artificial ingredients. Convenient packaging and the size of the bar makes them ideal snack for outdoor activities.

A2PHGY91PPE8PT	5	Great fruit bars	0	0	These are great tasting and make it easy to get fruit when fresh fruit isn't an option. Not as sweet as some other fruit bars I've had, but that isn't a bad thing.  I like that they don't have many ingredients in them too.
A3DWB9D6UXYP1	5	What a convenient way to enjoy fruit	0	0	The Gorge Delight Fruit Bars are an excellent product. They are pure fruit with no additives or preservatives. Each bar contains 2 servings of fruit. They are conveniently packaged and shelf stable so they can be carried in your briefcase or luggage and enjoyed whenever you need a snack. What an easy way to carry and enjoy fruit.

A19GA52H3OWW1R	5	Yummy from The Northwest	0	0	I learned to love these bars when my children lived near to the manufacturer.  Now that they no longer live there we order on line instead but what a treat!  And healthy for the active young adults as well as for my grandchildren, ages 2 1/2.
