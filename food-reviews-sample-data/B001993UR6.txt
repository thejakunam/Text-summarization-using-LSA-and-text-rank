AA48Z9PKOONPM	4	"Great high protein with ""touch of sweet"""	4	4	I really like these cinnamon crisps as a high protein snack with just a touch of sweet.  I do think they have a good cinnamon flavor, so my tastes are clearly different than the other reviewer.  I have been using these, as well as the other flavor (I especially like Italian Herb and Zesty Ranch in addition to the Cinnamon) for a couple of years and continue to enjoy them.  Really appreciate the way they curb my hunger and appetite for several hours, too!
A1RLLTUBCFQV22	5	pleasant sweet taste, good for blood glucose balance, filling	0	0	I enjoy the taste of these crisps--I'd call them a cross between a cinnamon cookie and a rice cake.  A bag has 130 calories, so I use half at a time as a between meal or before bedtime snack.  They have a low glycemic load, and are slowly absorbed and metabolized, thus leveling the blood glucose response. At under $2.00 a bag, they are also cost effective.
A29V32IOAJUP8P	4	Great low GI product	0	0	I appreciate this line of product. This particular one has a pleasing gentle cinnamon taste in your mouth. And they help me stay full and balanced (sugar wise) until my next meal. Great to throw in your gym bag or purse for those hungry moments.
A35ZH00A6IZHEQ	1	Terrible	2	4	Maybe I was expecting too much, but these taste terrible and the soy flavor is overpowering. They taste dry and chalky with little cinnamon flavor. There are much better low carb,low fat, high protein snacks!
