ANEKPEHODQW3R	5	Also good for baking	4	4	This oat bran is as finely ground as Quaker's and is less expensive. Finely ground oat bran is best for baking. (I use the recipes in The Oat Bran Baking Book by Nancy Baggett & Ruth Glick which you can find used here on Amazon.)<br /><br />Mother's Oat Bran also makes a smooth and delicious hot cereal. Make it with  milk instead of water for better flavor and creaminess.
AK5LUYO0MMBVV	5	creamy, delicious	4	4	This oat bran is delicious.  I use less oat bran and more water than recommended, as it is very thick, and I prefer it a little thinner.  Smooth, very quick cooking, and delicious, I eat it with maple syrup, currants, and a little skim milk or rice dream.  You will love it.
A2VUPZQZAC7MHP	5	Perfect breakfast	3	3	Mother's oat bran is not only very nutritious, but also very quick to make and my kids love it!!  And Amazon has the best price!
A3K91EVH7A7D19	5	the best	3	3	We have tried other oat brans, but this one has the best taste and texture.  Yet we cannot find it our local grocery stores anymore!
AQMI4UV92PBPG	5	The best oat bran available	3	3	Mother's oat bran is much more finely milled than any other brand I have tried.  As a result, I can add a couple of tablespoons worth to a variety of foods and still end up with a smooth texture.
A3BKIRWOV9BDCZ	5	Love this stuff	1	1	I have tried many oat bran cereals over the years and this is the smoothest of them all.  DCP
APE4BITU7SHEP	5	The Best	0	0	This is the best oat bran cereal.  None of the others matches it.<br /><br /> It can be hard to track down and Amazon hasn't always carried it.  So I'm always so relieved when I see it here and buy a 6 mo stock.  Great to have it on Prime too.<br /><br />My 94 year old mother has been eating this for breakfast for oh, the last 30 years or so.  She started it when her doctor told her she had to reduce her cholesterol.  And she did.<br />It's been her daily breakfast ever since (w 1/2 banana sliced,  a sprinkling of wheat bran, and a tblspn of yogurt).<br /><br />It also makes The Best Muffins (add raisins) - they have a kind of creaminess because the bran is so smooth.  My mom baked those almost daily when she was working at getting the cholesterol down.  They're simple but yummy addictive - and good for you.<br /><br />I think her oat bran cereal combo breakfast has helped keep my mom alive and healthy all these years.  That plus her daily chocolate and sherry!
