No need to add sugar or milk to the tea.  The cookies make up for the lack of sweetener.  I love to dip these extra crunchy cookies into the hot tea & nibble at them.  It is a heavenly treat!<br /><br />The cookies are bite sized & they are hard.  The minute you open the bag your senses will be delighted by the aroma of chocolate & orange.  They do not taste bland or like ""cardboard"" as some cookies of this type can taste.  Overall they are a decent cookie.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that they are not 100% Organic.  This entire line of Family Recipe cookies is not 100% Organic.  Since I don't have a lot of organic options, I will settle on this brand.  It is nice to have these when I have too much work to do around the farm or it is simply too hot out to have the oven on to make my own cookies - which are the best since home made cookies can't be beat!<br /><br />I also tried their Family Recipe Ginger Snaps & they were very tasty as well with little bits of chewy ginger in them.  The Ginger Snaps are another cookie perfect with hot tea as they too are hard & small. I plan on trying the Chocolate Chocolate Chip next."
