A3756EYZKC1CP4	5	Tastes great!  Promotes energy!	1	1	This product tastes wonderful and is invigorating.  It is great when you don't have time to eat a full<br />meal and will tide you over until your next meal.  It is best dissolved in a little warm water if mixing<br />by hand before adding the rest of the liquid.  A blender can be used to add in additional fruits or<br />vegetables.  Another added plus is that this product is certified kosher.  This truly is a delicious<br />flavor and a great product - enjoy!!!
A1RXS3NADEEEDC	4	Best Meal Replacement I Have Tried	1	1	As a rule I hate meal replacements, especially powders. I tried this because I was impressed with the Amazing Grass organic wheat grass.<br />The amazing meal would mix better with a blender. I use a spoon and add water until most of it eventually mixes. The taste is very good for a protein drink! The organic Madagascar Vanilla is delicious and the undercurrent of chai complements it well. The organic fruits and veggie in the drink are not detectable and so this is an easy way to get them in my diet. This is a gentle drink for when it is too late for dinner. It also works well for breakfast when my stomach needs something light. I feel pretty good when I have this drink, too.
A3OGA27565T0W	3	Not much vanilla taste	0	0	"I thought this would be good for morning smoothies with milk and fruit.  It really doesn't have much of a vanilla taste at all.  I also bought the berry and like that one much better used with juice .  If you add it to milk with a lot of fruit, I used one packet for two drinks it is ok.  Not my favorite taste but it does fill you up and hopefully gives you the vitamins it states it will.  I am going to keep trying to find ways to add it to drinks but I am sure no matter what you add to it, it will always taste like ""grass"" and will always be ""green""... I think it is worth the benefits if you can get past the taste."
