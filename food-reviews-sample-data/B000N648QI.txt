A3GBQEUWOFIPAV	5	thank goodness for grainfree	1	1	I have two cats, one who eats wet food as a last resort (mostly she licks up the gravy), and one who has food allergies (grains) and is incredibly picky (won't eat any grain free cat treats i've found so far--greenies, the tasty junk food ones, wellness cat jerky bits, shaved salmon, etc-- doesn't like catnip, and turns his nose up at anything that costs less than $1.29 a can it seems, to include spots stew; authority; organix; most flavors of avo-derm, holistic select, and innova; max cat; and natural choice).<br /><br />she still licks up the gravy, and eats about half her bowl. He eats his portion and finishes hers, with no vomiting or retching (so nice!). He also wakes me up in the morning if it's breakfast time and i haven't gotten the memo yet, and looks at me like i just kicked his grandma cat when i've run out.<br /><br />this has quite a bit of juice in it, which is good since most cats don't drink enough water anyway.<br /><br />as for me, i love this food b/c it doesn't smell to high heaven, and i haven't died from litterbox duty as of yet. ;) (get it? duty--dooty? hehe)
A35R32TA60XD57	5	Good product...great price!	0	0	This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food.
