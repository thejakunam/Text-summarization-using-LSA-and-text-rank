A1JGTIJ7G1NS8L	5	All that and then some....	7	7	The first time i tried Mina Harissa with chicken i was impressed with how much flavor it added to the meal. I then found myself using it almost every other day, with meat, fish, chips etc. This is a must condiment in my kitchen!
AHUSKF6FJE6XW	5	Great!	7	7	I've just purchased this sauce and it is delicious it was nice and hot and gives tons of flavor to my dishes , its a very versatile product and can be used for all sorts of food i.e. pasta, eggs, rice, chicken ... very good :)
A1L75XN9BJE47R	1	Buyers beware! This is not HARISSA!!!!	27	34	What a disappointment! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!<br /><br />I just got this product and it's definitely not HARISSA!<br /><br />I am Moroccan, born and raised and I know a thing or two about Moroccan food.<br /><br />HARISSA is a Tunisian hot chili sauce commonly eaten in North Africa.<br />Main ingredients are bird's eye chili peppers, Serrano peppers and other hot peppers , garlic, olive oil and SPICES such as coriander, cumin or caraway.<br />HARISSA is a very popular and standard condiment of North African cuisine (mostly Algeria and Tunisia) and only recently made inroads into Morocco according to Morocco food expert Paula Wolfert.<br /><br />Moroccan cuisine has been subject to Berber, Moorish, Mediterranean, and Arab influences and a wide variety of SPICES  are used by Moroccans to create delicious dishes.<br /><br />Here are the most important spices you will frequently encounter in Moroccan cooking:<br /><br />- karfa (cinnamon)<br /><br />- kamoun (cumin)<br /><br />- kharkoum (turmeric)<br /><br />- skinjbir (ginger)<br /><br />- libzar (pepper)<br /><br />- tahmira (paprika)<br /><br />- anise seeds<br /><br />- sesame seeds<br /><br />- qesbour (coriander)<br /><br />- zaafran beldi (saffron)<br /><br />- ras el hanout<br /><br />That said,  WHAT MAKES THIS HOT PEPPER SAUCE MOROCCAN? WHAT MAKES IT TRADITIONAL?<br /><br />Let's look at the ingredients list, shall we?<br /><br />`'Red Chili Pepper, Red Bell Pepper, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Vinegar, Salt''.<br /><br />I don't see anything that says `'Moroccan'', do you?<br /><br />And what about the `'traditional'' part?!!!<br />Very confusing and misleading.<br /><br /> I can't say that a lot of thought was put in the recipe.<br /><br />Dear fellow foodies and/or avid cooks, If you want to prepare foods with AUTHENTIC MOROCCAN flavors please do yourself a favor: look ELSEWHERE!<br /><br />This is a plain, ordinary hot pepper sauce. And not that cheap.<br /><br />Shame on this company for selling this hot pepper sauce under the name Harissa. Shame shame shame.
A249KX4SQ6ZFQX	5	ADDICTIVE HARISSA	6	6	I have tried so many Harissa sauces and have become addicted to Mina. I now use it with eggs, potatoes, lamb and pretty much everything else.<br />The best part is the spicy and tangy flavor that just is heavenly!!!
A36UHGHHABJLXC	5	The best of the best!	6	6	This has got to be my all time favorite. I use Mina Harrisa on just about everything. I have tried many different kinds but I have found the one that will stay in my kitchen forever. It is very good with chicken and most of all just to spread on my pita. I love this and probably could not see myself eating or cooking without it.
A16PQCH0W9SKW4	5	Positively the Best	6	6	I recently started cooking Moroccan dishes and therefore went through all the different harissa sauces to seek out the ones that I thought were the best - bottom line - this sauce is head and shoulders above the others in a variety of ways including overall flavor and spice - save yourself the timely process that I endured and use this one - you won't be disappointed.
A5R90BHSEKVO	5	Wow.. Amazing!!	6	6	This sauce is great for cooking, dipping, or just eating it by the spoonful.. Great fresh taste and a nice spicy kick!!  Loved it..
A3CR4N7ZH32732	5	perfect for everything	6	6	Ive had many harissa's. I use them for marinades, or just with bread. This one is the perfect balance. Spicy, but not too much. Very flavorful. LOVE IT!
A3W15F4XG2HEQL	5	I love this product	6	6	I had never tried a Harissa Sauce before.  I had a friend turn me on to this product and now I am hooked.  It compliments so many different foods adding great flavor and a nice kick.  It is also great as a dip.
A3MVZSDCVEU47	5	Excellent	8	9	I am a lover of Moroccan Food, I kept seeing this sauce at all the top gourmet markets in NY. Once I tried Mina Harissa, I was instantly addicted to it and now have to have it with all my Moroccan meals. By far one of the best sauces out there.
A28WW7HGTVZHNP	5	Sensational.	5	5	I fell in love with this Harissa. It's so good I put it on almost everything. Love that's all natural and healthy. Ordering another jar now. Highly recommend it.
A1SFRI8DS221IP	5	spice and flavor to my diet	5	5	I originally bought this for my husband who loves spicy foods. We had an amazing dinner party at the house where I mixed sauce in the white rice with some grilled Kebabs, this small addition made the food so authentic. Mixing it with the rice made me think of my diet and how bland my food has been this spring and alas i discovered a way to spice up my egg whites and make an actual dinner style dish out of this. It was so amazing and really made loosing weight so easy. I started to utilize this spice and it eliminated my cravings. I sauteed carrots then mixed some in, even used it as a dipping sauce for a eggplant that ended tasting like a gourmet infused far eastern salad...This sauce has really saved me from cheating on my diet. It works with everything!!!
A1D3GTK57QVLR8	5	Excellent!!!	7	8	I absolutely LOVED this sauce! If you are looking to add some heat and great flavor, Mina Harissa will add excellent flavor to almost anything. The spice and seasonings all meld together beautifully. It's also low in carbs, perfect for a health conscious person. I highly recommend it!
AF2KMJ6U4XOWZ	5	A transforming experience ..	7	8	The first time I tasted Harissa, I was in Northern Africa on business dining at local restaurants. Once de-virginized to the savory topping , I fell in love with this flavorful, zesty sauce. Years later I happened to attend a friends home for a dinner and on the table was a bottle of Mina's delicious Harissa sauce. Upon tasting this exotic delicacy , I was transformed back to Morocco savoring every bite. Since then, I've tried many different Harissa sauces, even a good friend of mine who happens to be a native of Morocco , claims her Harissa sauce is the best , However ,upon tasting Mina's Harissa she grudgingly had to admit that her Harissa does not compare to Mina's mouth watering, colorful blend of unique  ingredients. Nowadays, Mina's Harissa is a staple in my kitchen and I use it as a flavor booster, helping me expand my palate in most of my cooking, I also use it  as a topping on most of my sandwich's.Thank you Mina for sharing you secret recipe with the rest of the world and  giving us a taste of Heaven in every bottle..
A2ASTR6MC8AUH2	5	MUST TRY	7	8	By far the best Harissa I've tried, EVER. Truly authentic, Moroccan spice. Not too spicy nor mild. Forever a mainstay in my cupboard.
A2WKXSW1RA8HHK	5	Excellent sauce, great spice	7	8	Great sauce - definitely a good find.  Used it with chicken and rice tonight, adds a great flavor with a kick.
A19YGLGKSYPA18	5	The Future of Hot Sauce	7	8	I bought this in NYC when I saw it after reading about how Harissa is an upcoming thing in the food world. I can't believe how simple it is(and all natural) with the flavor it packs. Excellent as a dip too. I can say is I've found my Tabasco replacement!
A29I72GGIDNLDA	5	I am in LOVE with this sauce.  Best addition to eggs I've ever had.	6	7	I came across this Mina Harissa spicy sauce by chance.  It absolutely knocked my socks off, and I am in love.<br />My first time at it, I started off pretty conservatively with scrambled eggs.  After the first bite, I have since<br />fallen TOTALLY in love with this sauce, I put loads of it on and cover every square inch of my plate, and I refuse to make scrambled eggs unless I have this sauce...<br />no joke, buy this sauce, and you will experience happiness.  That is, until you run out ;)  If you dig hot sauce, you should probably buy two or so right off the bat.<br /><br />Once you try this sauce, you will be hooked.  Gauranteed.
A3SLPMMS7FY0I6	5	Really Good	3	3	This is a great harissa sauce and it's very healthy. My GF is on a diet and eats it with everything to boost the flavor of her boring diet food. I'm going to start hiding it from her because she finishes it ALL! Highly recommended.
A2VZHV3U07NPN8	5	Delicious	7	9	I was having a hard time finding authentic Harissa and I finally found it.  I highly recommend Mina. Very flavorful and delicious. Totally reminds me of our amazing trip to Morocco. It is so hard to find real Harissa and This definitely hit the mark.
A21DNTEDF75PWT	5	You have to try this !!!!	1	1	I have tried other similar sauces, but this one is really the best.Amazing chili flavor with perfect spice. This is a must try.
A1FAC12QRBRA78	5	Great Harissa	1	1	This is a great harissa... I've tried a few others but Mina is my fav by far. Great flavor and just the right amount of heat. Love this sauce. I'm addicted.
A2GBRFK1PM5EGA	1	Not bad, but NOT HARISSA	0	0	"I am giving this product a 1-star review not becuase it tastes bad, but because it is not what it claims to be.  Harissa is a north-African condiment comprised primarily of chile peppers.  This product claims it can be used as a dip and is comprised primary of red bell peppers. (Of the seven ingredients listed, chile peppers are next to last.  No traditional Moroccan spices, such as cumin, are present in this product)<br /><br />To put it in American terms, this is equivalent to purchasing a product called ""Traditional American ketchup"", only to discover that it is made out of red peppers instead of tomatoes.<br /><br />Again, I am not saying that this is a bad-tasting product - you might enjoy it.  My complaint is the claim that it's a ""Traditional Moroccan"" condiment.  As other reviewers suggest, a product like Mustafa's harissa is closer to the real deal."
A2DXPZOFMT3QDU	1	Bogus Harissa,  a poser	0	1	This is nothing like the real thing ! I am unable to understand why the amount of positive reviews .<br />I bought this since I was unable to find Mustaphas in Wegmans supermarket here in NY.<br />To buy Mustaphas online is expensive !! product price not so bad, but when  the shipping is added it is quite pricey ( but well worth every cent)<br />please trust me on this it is worth it ! I buy mine in the pack of three saves a bit and I use them quickly , However if you really enjoy Mina and are 5 star happy with it great !! I am happy for you.<br />But I can say this with complete honesty once you have tried Mustaphas I doubt you will ever want to buy any other . So How do I describe how wonderful a product Mustaphas Moccican Harissa is ?and how the two compare ( they are so different )<br />Mina is thin weak almost tasting like it came from a can .<br />Mustaphas is thick almost as thick as tomato paste with a beautiful deep rich flavor and color which is beautiful, the heat is wonderful, ( you must be able to enjoy the heat) but it is not just raw heat, it is flavor a depth of flavor that almost allows you to picture Mustaphas being made in small homemade batches by artisans who know the taste they are crafting  the flavor will transport you ( no magic carpet required ) and you will find so many uses for it .again the flavor is rich sumptuous the level of heat can be adjusted by the amount you use it takes very little to enjoy the rich flavor and it melds with everything but it is hot .<br />I could not find anything that I could use Mina on, I tried, it was 9.00 for the jar and I felt I must try top like it but in the end I yet threw away a nearly full jar of Mina in a household where even the youngest grandchildren love hot sauces and Harissa ( in small amounts )<br />no one at all liked the Mina product !! My fridge has many bottles of hot sauces, We go through so many, a big favorite is Marie Sharps one of the most flavorful hot sauces We have ever had discovered it years ago when in Belize. I say this so that I might offer you a reference point of my personal taste .I do not mean to compare them as similar products, both are quite different except for astounding flavor, uniqueness, and quality .I hope that this review helps ( and that you will forgive the gramatical errors ).Please check out Mustaphas available on the Amazon site the jar does not show the name in a pronounced way the print that shows the name of the brand is small the words Morrican Harissa might help identify or just do a search . but look for it, try it, do not judge Harissa by Mina !! there can be no comparison between the two .If you are happy with Mina so be it .but if it is the only one you have tried then try Mustaphas take a chance, just be ready to buy a lot of it since you will find so many uses for it, and you will miss it when you run out to be sure .Thanks for listening to sum it up ,I do not like the Mina product at all !! I will not belittle it anymore than I have .I would rather offer you positives and Mustaphas is that positive to be sure .Thanks again
A15XHM57JZZMYF	1	HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1	3	"This ""Harissa"" tastes like lightly spiced canned pasta sauce.  The only reason I purchased it is because I can't find Mustapha's Harissa anywhere else.  Hopefully they start making it again.  Till then, I will abstain from store bought harissa."
