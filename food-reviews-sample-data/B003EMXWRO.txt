A3GIZ0VFD8CS47	3	Not 5lbs, but still fireballs	10	10	"Fireballs are the only candy worth eating.  That's why I ordered this 5 pound container.  What I received was the standard hexagonal, 200 count container sold all over amazon for a little lower price.  The original package label indicates 3 lbs 15 oz, which is accurate (confirmed using my shipping scale).  Bottom line, fireballs rule, but you can find this same package for cheaper.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EMXWRO"">Atomic Fireballs: 5LBS</a>"
A3RSO00CPDRHW7	3	Smaller than they appear	5	5	The fireballs are much smaller than they appear.  In other words, they are not the usual size of fireball - they are miniatures.  Not what I expected - never would have ordered had I known they were so small.
A1G72P5LRW2C3A	3	These are the small Fireballs, not the large ones.	2	2	I have nearly finished my container of Ferrera Pan atomic fireballs, and ordered this package to refill it.  The package arrived, and to my disappointment, these were the small size fireballs, and not the larger size shipped with the candy jar container.<br /><br />These are the same firey hot cinnamon candies provided in the container, but it would be nice if the product specifications clearly stated that they were the smaller of the two sizes.<br /><br />Other than that, they're great.
A1LZVIPXRE6OZV	5	So happy	0	0	I just received my HUGE bag of candy!  I forgot how great these things were.  I placed my order late Saturday night at 10:45 PM and my package got here Wednesday at 12:45 PM.  I used regular shipping and I am quite impressed and how fast this order was completed.  I will use this vendor again.  I got what I ordered although I didn't expect the bag to be SO big.  :)
