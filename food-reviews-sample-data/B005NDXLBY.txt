Faced w/ 3 confusing choices: ship & deliver ASAP, ship whenever, deliver in time for Christmas. I chose the first thinking it was the fastest. My items were not delivered until 12/27. When I contacted Swiss Colony, they said, ""Too bad.""<br /><br />Next time I'll get real petit fours shipped from an actual bakery."
A3Q40E2UQP4KGI	4	Great Cakes!	0	0	These cakes are fairly exploding with flavor and the kids love making charts depicting which flavors can be found under the robes of confection.  We order these at nearly every special occasion.  One warning that merited knocking a star off is that there are invariably four or five within the box that are hard and dry within.  That's not very nice when serving these to guests and there is no way to tell just by looking at it.<br /><br />Also, my last batch had one whole flavor (the chocolate-robed with green diagonal stripes) where every one of them was dry.  It only happened once and my family loves these too much to knock it down another star for that.
