A3UF4K552BJ1VC	5	Our favorite by far	2	2	Jif Extra Crunchy Peanut butter is the best tasting buy far. We have tried many brands and have settled on this one as our favorite. We like the big chuncks of peanuts and just like to just eat it by the spoonfull as a snack. Yum!

I have tried many others,but I still rate this tops. The only bad thing I can say about my last order, is that it arrived with one of the plastic jars, and its top broken. I think that is was dropped on the warehouse floor before boxing. I wanted the product NOW, so one was opened and enjoyed while one went into the trash. That ended up being the most expensive peanut butter ever bought. I just savored what I had."
