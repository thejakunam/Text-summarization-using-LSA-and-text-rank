A3BUSOPF5WB0PX	5	Got what I wanted!	2	2	When looking for this product online (since I couldn't find it in ANY stores) I was concerned because the picture of the product did not match the product name.  After doing much research I found out the UPC number & used it to determine if this was indeed the product I was looking for.  Once confirmed, I ordered it & kept my fingers crossed that it was what I was looking for.... it was!! I was delighted because I absolutely love the Kraft SWEET Balsamic Vinaigrette on my spinach/strawberry salad.  NOTE ~ I spoke with an Amazon representative & he could not verify that this was indeed what I was looking for... thus the reason for the research I had to perform.<br /><br />But, I am happy to report after all this I am happy to have my favorite dressing so that I can enjoy my favorite salad!
A15513DYPQWF9D	5	Finally!  A balsamic that isn't sour!	0	0	I'v been a balsamic lover for years, but I could never find a pre-made one that I liked.  I tried cheap ones (Newman's, Ken's) and expensive ones (fancy glass bottles is the only thing I can remember), but nothing was as good as what I could a) pay a lot for in a restaurant OR b) make myself by simmering balsamic on the stove and dissolving raw sugar in it- time consuming!<br /><br />I was so happy when we went to my in-laws for Christmas and they had this (ok, it was the ONE benefit of Christmas with my in-laws).  Although I can't find it in the stores where I live, I'm so glad I can find it online.
A1Y6L047MI2497	5	love this dressing	0	0	I bought this product and it is delicious!!!! I could drink it from the bottle,no kidding. I usually don't write reviews, but I am soooo disappointed that I cannot find in stores in my area. I called Kraft foods ans was told there is no store within a 50 mile radius, I am very disappointed; but I can buy it on amazon.com. I hopr the stores will start selling it because it is a keeper!!!
