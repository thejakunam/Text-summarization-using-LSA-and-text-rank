A4AH5HQF5OMFX	5	Pom loves this brand	1	1	"my picky pom loves this brand.  I rotate between 3 flavors (he won't eat same flavor more than 2 days).  I love that they are grain free, organic, and small enough for his tiny mouth. He has rejected several other ""natural"" dry or dehydrated raw dog foods -- Orijen, Addiction (he liked this for awhile), Canidae, Stella and Chewy's, etc. No digestive problems, no stinky breath (why would I want pizza or even fishy dog breath?).  I have tried all the Acana dry foods --I order the trial size so they stay fresh -- and the price is reasonable for the quality."
A26ZQUATEV1CQI	5	my dogs LOVE it	1	1	I just started my dogs on this food 3 days ago and they love it.<br /> No trying to add things to get them to eat, they clean their plates.<br />I have used Orijen in the past and my dogs have always enjoyed that food. It is a bit too expensive for me since I also have to buy very good quality canned for my diabetic dog.<br />My daughter decided to try this since it is made by the same company as Orijen. With all the food recall scares lately, this company has a very good reputation, uses quality ingredients, they have their OWN factory and they have had no recalls.
