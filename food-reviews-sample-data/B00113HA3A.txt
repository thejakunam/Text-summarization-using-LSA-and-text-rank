A2ZSC81MXLBELX	4	Nice Change Of Pace and Super Antioxidants	10	12	"To say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My earlier experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant,or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. For me it was coffee, coffee, and more coffee.<br /><br />However,hearing so much about the benefits of green tea,I picked out a box of it at the store and put it up on my shelf.It just sat there. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG"">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> -see my review for details of the Lemongrass - I loved it. It was the best I tried. Naturally I found the best deal here at Amazon.<br /><br />Next I wanted to try other flavors. This Orange flavored sounded pretty good. It has the added benefits of super anitoxidant(70% more than Good Earth's standard green tea) Japanese teas matcha and sencha. I found both the aroma and taste much lighter than the Lemongrass. The Orange gives just a hint of it's flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise, so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it's great for what ails ya. It's definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don't need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffee per serving. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />From the box:<br />Ingredients: Sencha Green Tea,Orange Oil,Green Tea Extract,Natural Flavors,Matcha and Chamomile Flowers.<br /><br />Super Green Tea - 162 mg avg antioxidants per serving.<br />Good Earth Standard Green tea -108 mg avg antioxidants per serving<br /><br />So I still love that morning cup of Java, but now I look forward to my afternoon Green Tea as well.Now I would find it a disaster to be without that! I even took some with me on a recent road trip - just to be sure I had some wherever I went.<br /><br />Remember to breathe,eat healthy and...enjoy the holidays!....Laurie"
A3HJHV83O2U8BL	5	Delicious flavor and aroma - this is a winner; but by what margin?	6	7	"I've been enjoying black, green, and herbal teas for years. Normally I keep a good supply of both <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BN4"">Bigelow English Teatime Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRM6"">Bigelow Decaffeinated Organic Green Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> in the pantry. Recently my wife was given a ""Variety Pack"" of Good Earth teas and this particular tea was included. I'm a morning coffee drinker but after my two cups of French pressed Colombian Joe to get the motor running I switch to tea; normally a cup or two of the aforementioned Bigelow English Breakfast tea and as the day progresses I like to decrease the caffeine intake so I switch over to the Bigelow Green which is a decaffeinated tea. However, as teas go, green tea is relatively low in caffeine so the idea of switching to a regular, caffeinated green tea, really didn't bother me. Anyway, as soon as I enjoyed my first cup of this particular tea I new I had to make room in the cupboard; at least until I finished my supply of the Bigelow green.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed and enjoyed about this tea was the wonderful bouquet like aroma. Just like with a fine red wine the initial aroma/bouquet is part of the experience of enjoying good wine and flavored hot beverages. After the delicious aroma test passed with flying colors it was not surprising that the taste test would be at least equally if not more satisfying. Indeed it tasted delicious.<br /><br />As with any good quality green tea the flavor was fresh, light, and a bit grassy or ""green"". I was previously not familiar with ""Matcha"" or ""Sencha"", two of the three flavor additions to this tea but thanks to the internet, information about darned near anything is always nearby. I'm not going to Wikipedia you about Matcha and Sencha but suffice it to say they are both other forms of Japanese green teas that do in fact pack a powerful additional punch of antioxidants genuinely verifying the company's advertisment of ""...more antioxidants"".<br /><br />Allegedly this tea has 70% more antioxidants than their ""Standard Green Tea"". This claim though, stretches the truth. Comparing the two products nutritional information: Good Earth's Super Green Tea has 162mg avg. antioxidants per serving whereas their Standard Green Tea has 108mg avg. per serving. According to my calculator that's 50% more (162/108 = 1.5) It annoys me when companies make misleading claims. In cases such as this though I find it simply hard to understand why they would stretch the truth. Based upon the product as it stands, they really don't need to inflate this percentage. The tea is delicious, it's got more antioxidants, why don't they print that or print that ""our Standard Green Tea has 67% fewer antioxidants than our Super Green Tea! LOL. Okay so that whole thing I wrote about the percentage of antioxidants is really pretty irrelevant, I know, but I had fun doing it. Sorry if I lost you, it's just all in good fun.<br /><br />The real FLAVOR FLASH in this Super Green Tea is the ORANGE. I think it's great. It tastes like they've added just the right amount of fresh orange zest to set this green tea apart from unflavored ones and it's a combination that works. And why shouldn't it? Citrus flavoring with tea is certainly nothing new.<br /><br />Now the claim that follows is my own and it is supported by the following facts and data: At the time of this writing there were eleven customer reviews on Amazon's Web site for this product. Ten of those reviews were positive (i.e. 4 or 5 stars) and one was neutral (3 stars). By my calculator that means that 91.7& (rounded) of the population really like this tea and NOBODY dislikes it. Based upon the facts and data I think it's safe to buy some for yourself. But, you may well be an outlier and not like it at all so, to be really safe and smart, if you haven't already tried it, buy a box at your local grocery store. If you like it come back to Amazon and get in on their Subscribe and Save Program.<br /><br />I like buying Bigelow brand teas primarily because I like their flavor and believe they use fresh high quality teas, but also, and nearly equally as important, is because of how they are packaged; that is each tea bag is individually packaged in a fully sealed foil-like pouch. While this certainly adds to the cost it also helps assure freshness is maintained; an absolutely essential element in ensuring a good cup of tea. This variety of Good Earth tea is packaged in the same, high quality, freshness maintaining manner.<br /><br />Just a final general note on brewing green tea: Just as you would brew any other kind of tea, whether you have bagged tea or loose green tea, one thing to watch out for: Don't use fully boiling water. Green tea is more delicate than black, so it's best to keep the water a little cooler. Brewing when your water is just about to hit the boil is ideal.<br /><br />Bon appetit!"
AHJYC27FSYS5X	5	Very, very good	5	6	This is one of the best bagged green teas I have ever tried, and I have tried quite a few. I normally use loose green tea, but have been trying to be more budget-conscious. This tea is a light green the way it's supposed to be, not the oxidized brown. Try it, you will like it!
A1IM0T8O1Y7F3P	5	Best Green Tea	5	6	This is my favorite Green tea! I have 3 or 4 cups a day. The orange favor is great. You can actually smell the oranges when sniffing the tea bag and it is far fresher than your standard teas like Lipton. Besides the great taste, it has 70% more anti-oxidants than your typical Green tea. Also I should mention I have been drinking this tea as part of my workout and diet regime and have lost 25 pounds! Here is an article on how green tea helps with weight loss: http://www.benefitsofgreentea.info/2007/powerful-super-green-tea-diet.php.
A60YEMT76IX05	5	Makes FANTASTIC iced tea!	2	2	Good Earth Super Green Tea makes the world's best iced tea, hands down.  It's great hot, but it's fantastic iced.  Drop in an orange slice and you've got yourself the most delicious, refreshing, great-for-you beverage you've ever tasted. Even if you're not a tea lover, you'll love this stuff!
A3EYGXPYR8IAVD	5	Tasty green tea	2	2	"I originally bought this at a grocery store as part of a project to find a green tea that my husband would drink.  He's got a health condition that demands he give up coffee, and the only tea ""allowed"" is Green Tea (due to the reported health benefits).<br /><br />We tried many brands and many varieties and this one has a good flavor...kinda citrus-y and not watery or bitter.  The pleasant aroma hits you when you open the package. That's another benefit, the tea bags come individually packaged so they stay fresh and also travel well, if need be.  The tea bags come with nice little sayings printed on them, too.<br /><br />I ordered these through Amazon because the product has become hard to find in local stores, and the bulk price is fair.  It is cheaper still if you subscribe."
A1SB56S0DIDRGN	5	Yummy green tea	1	1	"I know green tea is good for you so until now I've forced myself to drink it. I'd even ""hide"" it in black tea but could still taste it.  I drink this plain, and at will!! It's really good hot or iced.  Compared to the whole foods stores, you'll save a bundle buying in the 6-pack AND amazon ships SO fast.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase."
A1WF730XLZ639Y	5	WOW! GIVES ME ENERGY & HEALS WHATEVER ACHES	1	1	I HAVE CONSISTANT MIGRANES EVREY MONTH.

ATEKXH8FNRPEE	5	This is really good tea...	2	3	I've always bought the Good Earth Lemongrass Green Tea, but I wanted to try something new so I bought this Super Green Tea. The Lemongrass tea is probably the best green tea I've ever had, so naturally I didn't have high expectations going into this tea. After opening the teabag of this Super Green Tea, I knew immediately that I was going to love this tea. You can smell all the aromas of the tea and none of them are overwhelming on the nose. Once brewed, I couldn't stop drinking this tea. Like the Lemongrass tea, each of this tea's flavors are brought out and none of them are overbearing. The orange oil is perfect; not too much nor too little is in the tea. After drinking two cups of this tea, I'm ready to say that this tea has replaced the Good Earth Lemongrass tea as my go to green tea.
A3AURNIQOJ9UJB	4	Tastes great	0	0	This is an great green tea choice if you like a blend of different teas.  I thought it was well-balanced and tasted great overall.
AOEGAN8CHX3V0	5	My favorite tea.	0	0	wonderful aroma and taste. goes down smooth. i add a little honey and some drops of lemon concentrate into it. so delicious. no more than 1 - 3 cups in a day.  Moderation
A24TKUGFBH80XD	5	Super Tea Time	1	2	"""This green tea blending with two of Japan's most popular teas is a nice paring for the best antioxidant tea by Good Earth. Good Earth Super Green Tea has 162mg avg. antioxidants per serving vs. Good Earth's standard green tea with 108mg avg. antioxidants per serving.  Orange flavor may be slightly strong/rinded to some as it is for me. I put one of these Super Green tea bags in with another tea bag flavor in a 3/12 quart Tea Pot, namely Good Earth's Original, Constant Comment Original or any Oolong Tea from China's Fujian province . Leave it on the warmer for about 30min before serving. I even water it down another 50 percent after taking the tea bags out. It is also very good with a shot of Citron\Mandarin\Peach Vodka if you ever go that route."""
A2AG7UNGNI58O4	5	Great tea!	4	7	I love this tea!!  To perfect my mornings, after brewing this tea, I add Madhava Light Agave Nectar and a little Silk Vanilla Creamer--Wow.  It even satisfies my sweet tooth.
A254ZQVYZ4N98H	5	The Best Green Tea!	0	1	This tea is the tastiest green tea I have ever had.  Highly recommemd it to everyone. I drink it every day and hope that all the anti-occidents are doing their magic.
A2FOG4X5Z7QGAE	3	Orange flavor too strong	2	5	The orange oil is quite dominant in this tea. I don't feel the flavors blend well. I much prefer Good Earth's Green Tea with Lemongrass, where the flavors are more subtle.
