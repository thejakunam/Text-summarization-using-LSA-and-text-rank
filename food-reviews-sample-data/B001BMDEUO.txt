A1K7OUOZGT6EG3	5	Deboles is good pasta	5	5	"Just because of the bad review based on packaging above let me say Deboles makes top of the line pasta and we are extremely lucky to get the deals we do from amazon. You can pay double or triple the price in any store that sells this pasta. The recipe for their Jerusalem Artichoke pasta is the same for all types afaik so I would direct you to reviews of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0JOSO"">De Boles Pasta Organic Artichoke Fettuccine, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. To that I can only add that with regular semolina pasta it took about double the amount to fill me up as the Deboles Jerusalem Artichoke which stands to reason because it's got 2x the protein. Just be advised with this deal (2.40/lb is a great deal) you'll want a tub or some kind of jar (2 gallons will do) to hold 10lbs of pasta."

A288Z1VZZ3UC83	5	Best Ever Pasta	1	1	DeBoles elbows are better than any other elbows I've tried. Believe me, at my age, that is a lot! However, as one reviewer stated, the product does come in a plastic bag.<br /><br />Rest assured, it IS what you are ordering.  How do I know? Went to another web site and viewed a large image of the elbows in the box from DeBoles.<br /><br />The pasta's are exact.  There is what appear to be cracks in the pasta.  All is good however!<br /><br />This product is genuine and excellent for your health. Especially if you are diabetic.<br /><br />I reordered these elbows to make macaroni salad for a friend who is diabetic.  She will appreciate that when she checks her glucose levels.<br /><br />Love this product and wish everyone would try it at least once.
