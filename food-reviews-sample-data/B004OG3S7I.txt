A2EJ25IBOMD2KY	5	My son loved this!	3	3	These mustache candies are adorable!! My 22 year old son loved them in his Christmas stocking.  The tin is nice and can be used again.
A3DE0SNPHU1RZG	4	You're paying for the tin	0	0	For Father's Day I presented dear old Dad with all moustache-themed gifts; these candies made the cut.  The candy itself is quite off putting...as while itty bitty 'staches are adorable, the fact that they're a smokey black/gray color makes the brain think of licorice or, well, anything that isn't fruity. But they're indeed generically fruit-flavored. Not too tasty and pretty darn hard. Not sure we recieved the freshest batch, but I think had they been more gummy or even passably soft they'd have scored higher on the taste scale.<br /><br />But the fact is you buy this sort of novelty as a stocking stuffer type of gift, or, in my case, just to go with a theme. The tin is well made and Dad will probably use it to store some tiny, albeit manly man odds & ends. Is it overpriced for what you actually get? You betcha! But since they don't sell moustache candy at every corner store, the price is worth the smile.<br /><br />Just skip actually eating the candy... unless chipping a tooth is kind of your thing or if you're on the 'dark grey food only' diet. And of course, understand it's a small piece and won't feed (if you're brave) the entire neighborhood. Small 'stache for lots of cash.<br /><br />4 stars for the novelty tin, 1 star for the contents. If you're dead set on mustache candy and have teeth as mighty as Chuck Norris, order away!
