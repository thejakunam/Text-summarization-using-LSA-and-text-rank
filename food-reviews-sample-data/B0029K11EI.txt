AW3VZ5O895LRK	5	Excellent Coffee if You Like Dark, Strong and Robust	7	7	"I like my coffee dark, strong, bold and black, no sweeteners, no cream.  This is thus an ideal coffee for me.  If you like a much milder coffee, say medium roast, you may not like it nearly as much as I do. If you like cream and sugar, that may just ruin this coffee as it will dilute its strength and ""strong"" is what this coffee is all about..  The statements made in the description of this coffee here at Amazon are correct, i.e. the taste of an Italian roast with hints of chocolate overlaying it. Lately I've been able to buy mine at Sam's Club locally in a big bag for $16."
A82GWNQ8RVNW7	1	awful	5	5	I got two pack of 3, all made two years ago, and will be expired after 3 months.<br />When I open them, all of them has fishy smell.
A3AMDTB5CZYAP	5	The best!	7	8	This is my favorite coffee of all time!  It's just perfect.  Not too strong and not too weak.  I've tried many and this is the one I always grab.  Of course you must buy the whole bean and grind it yourself because it will always taste a million times better.  I don't find the price to be a problem at all compared to other coffee brands.  I do always make sure to get it on sale AND if you happen to have a Kroger nearby you can usually get a bag for around $7.00 which if (like me)  you have a husband who doesn't do coffee, it'll last you at least two weeks! :D
ALMT9DHA5BTZR	4	Yum	3	3	Probably the best flavor offered by Starbucks.  Price is slightly better then the store (especially if you have Amazon Prime).
A1MQ1SEJFYIPY6	1	Peter	2	2	Apparently the seller, atoz4less2012, does this a lot. I received 2 bags of ground coffee and 1 bag of whole bean, all well past their sell-by date.
A2PL4XNK9QYFF9	5	starbucks Verona	1	1	Verona is by far the best coffee made by Starbucks. Buying in bean form it has much more flavor than if bought already ground. More robust and richer taste.
A259HP9S1MTHGI	5	Starbucks	1	1	It was a great buy and the coffee tasted quite fresh . Much better deal than getting in grocery store .
A2M1D38XU5V35H	1	Cofffee was stale	1	1	Starbucks Verona blend is my favorite coffee.  However, the coffee I received was outdated and stale.  The expiration date on the packages was December 2011, and I received the coffee in late April, 2012.  The coffee both smelled and tasted stale.
A3TGF76AQFLWYZ	3	Nice, but just get it on sale at the store!	1	1	The coffee itself is good.  Bold, Robust flavor.. it's just that you can get the same thing at the store when  it's on sale for cheaper.
A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5	5	Prepare yourself for a rich coffee experience.	1	1	Starbucks Caffe Verona is one of the most full-bodied, aromatic coffees sold by Starbucks.  It can be enjoyed at any time of day, but it is best served to late-afternoon guests or after dinner with dessert.  To anyone familiar with the rich aroma of coffee beans roasting, this coffee tastes like that smell.  Few cups are as fraught with flavor and richness as Caffe Verona, short of a well-crafted macchiato.<br /><br />In spite of its boldness, this coffee manages to retain its distinctive characteristics.  Where some of the darker roasts tend to become uniform and mundane, Caffe Verona is unmistakably unique and memorable.  Its flavor and aroma linger long after you have finished the cup.<br /><br />Whether you are the kind of person who gets hooked on one coffee, or if you like to try different kinds, this pack of three is simply a great deal.  If you truly, truly enjoy coffee, I can almost guarantee you will enjoy Caffe Verona.
A2L71IVF2TEYM5	5	My Mom's Love the Coffee	1	1	This coffee was a gift for my mother. She says she really liked the taste. Mom likes a bold coffee and this blend suited her just fine.
A1DN616WGFTW2G	5	Great work coffee pot coffee	1	1	Great work coffee pot coffee.  I use this at work and whenever I have a student drag by sniffing, I give them this.  They are grateful and really like this brew too.!
A1CRP2IMWYBFEF	5	Love that coffee	1	1	Starbuck`s Caffe Verona...love that coffee and being able to get a special Amazon deal makes it extra  enjoyable.
A30CV4T4I9Y89P	5	Order this yesterday and it is already here!	2	3	Great service and the price can't be beat. I love this coffee and prices are going up weekly at the store. This is worth checking out if you drink coffee every day. Great value.
A19UX86JRN4E70	1	Stale Coffee	2	3	The package was dated Feb. and I ordered and received the coffee on the last week of Sept.<br />On the other hand, the service from Amazon was great.
A2QC9920F42ORM	5	Save A Trip to Starbucks - Tastes Just as Fresh I Think!	0	0	We brew our own coffee but are addicted to Starbucks after my Starbucks barista son giving us free coffee for a while! Rather than make a trip to the store, we ordered here and were pleased how quickly we received and how fresh the coffee tasted.
A2YEV05XY5GJ9U	5	so pleasantly surprised!!	0	0	I am a coffee fanatic who still just drips it through my Melitta cone.  After I read the reviews, I was still skeptical because this came out to a great per pound price and was supposedly similar to Petes.  This one tastes fresh, layered and stands up to a $17.99 per pound coffee I have had.  This one is a winner.
A2Q4UX9QHLX9K8	5	The Best Coffee!!	0	0	Cafe Verona is our favorite coffee. It is bold and robust without being bitter.  As far as the seller, everything was great there also. Package arrived on time, actually sooner than expected. Will buy from again. Try this coffee, you will not be disappointed.
A3AGBJ6FYKE6O4	4	love the coffee	0	0	if i could i would buy everything on amazonis quick simple and as i am aging, a rilief not to have to go out in the snow and ice of upstate ny
A5R738LU8LSUB	5	Favorite!	0	0	I try all types of dark roast, Starbucks & others. There is no other way to say it. For me, this has the most intense deep flavor. This is my ULTIMATE COFFEE!
A1Y3OPYLRYJJF2	5	Awesome value	0	0	I will always buy this 3 pack from Amazon, bought separately in the store this item is $7 or $8 a piece. This three pack is a great value, can't be beat, especially if you are an Amazone Prime member!
A2EUBM7HTPCZJ5	5	Starbucks Verona Coffee	0	1	I dont think they make this blend at the stores anymore so this might become a collectors item.  I purchased an extra few in hopes of selling for like $100 a bag in the future.  A bunch are in my freezer staying fresh.  Oh this coffee is soooo good.  It takes care of me in the morning on my ride to work.  Only don't even try to follow the instructions on the bag for home brewing this blend because for real yo you'll get sick in the head from all the caffeine.  So to sum up, buy it while you can- its as good as gold$$!!  Yeah baby!!!
A1OPLCTF66A49X	3	caution!!	0	1	i am a fan of this coffee, and have bought it many times before in the starbucks stores.  i thought this was a good deal buying it through amazon, until i realized that these are NOT the same size bags that starbucks sells!<br /><br />so just be aware -- these are only 12 OUNCE bags!!!<br /><br />(no complaint on the coffee itself though)
A3EBHHCZO6V2A4	4	The course of true espresso never did run smooth	3	7	"Starbucks' Caffe Verona is a perfectly romantic blend. It has the boldness of forbidden love,the warmth of passion, and the bittersweetness that's redolent of most Italian coffees. It's more of a wake-up blend than Starbucks' Morning one, for this recalls Romeo and Juliet awakening after the ardor of their wedding night <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199535892"">The Oxford Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet (Oxford World's Classics: the Oxford Shakespeare)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792165055"">Romeo & Juliet</a><br /><br />Caffe Verona isn't a weak coffee. It's not like a tepid romance novel. It's strong enough for the early morning... and even works in a chili with unsweetened cocoa and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB2GGQ"">S & W, Bean Rr Santa Fe, 15.5-Ounce (12 Pack)</a><br /><br />Caffe Verona is bittersweet--like a good chocolate or forbidden passion. It's delicious!"
