AEWPDAPDXBJ0J	5	Just try it!	1	1	Never heard of fish tacos. They would be the last thing I would order on a menu. Having a freezer full of fish made me try some other options and I stumbled onto this! Man, is it good. Ordered two more boxes for my friends in Alaska. They can't get enough! Makes a great taco salad, too.
A1JK688M7VEUP4	5	Favorite Fish Tacos!!	1	1	After being introduced to fish tacos in California, I was determined to duplicate the recipe at home. I had tried a number of variations with different seasonings and types of fish. I decided to give this seasoning a try and it is now a family favorite!  It has a lighter flavor than regular taco seasonings, with more of an emphasis on herbal/citrus notes (which I emphasize with lots of fresh lime juice).  I tend to use tilapia most often, but it also works well with catfish, salmon, and trout. Enjoy!

I finally found this product and if I'm making fish tacos, I'm using this seasoning.  It's not quite as good as restaurant style fish tacos, but it's close enough!<br /><br />It's definitely worth a look!
