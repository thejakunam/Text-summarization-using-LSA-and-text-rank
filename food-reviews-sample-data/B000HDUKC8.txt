A326NWGQAE0Q2K	3	ok sprinkles	0	0	i was ordering these sprinkles to decorate goodies for my son's 2nd bday party...  they arrived promptly, however just looking at the contents in the bag it appears a lot of the sprinkles are broken and now in crumbs...  i haven't opened the bag yet to see the extent of the damage, but i'm thinking it may have come in better condition if it were in a hard container like sprinkles you buy at the store (these sprinkles were in a bag & shipped in a box)...

A38FLKKAANZRQL	5	Exactly what I wanted!	0	0	These are perfect and super cute, they were exactly what I wanted to finish off my daughters 1st birthday cupcakes and cake.  The colors are just as vibrant as the picture.  The only downfall was that there were quite a few broken ones but they were still adorable on the cakes, so much so that I ordered a second bag after doing the test cake.  I'm going to solely use these instead of attempting to draw his face again.  I will definitely shop again!
