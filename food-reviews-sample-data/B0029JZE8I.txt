A3EPHBMU07LZ50	5	So good you could eat it by the spoonful!	1	1	The Betty Crocker Rich and Creamy Frosting Coconut Pecan frosting is so good you could literally eat it by the spoon full! While this frosting is good on German Chocolate cake you can also frost chocolate brownies to make German Chocolate-style brownies instead.<br /><br />Recommend.
A3ENN12GLNTUAF	5	Delicious for more than frosting cakes!	1	1	"Just a quick review here to share a couple of ways we now use this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JZE8I"">Betty Crocker Rich & Creamy Frosting, Coconut Pecan, 14.5-Ounce Containers (Pack of 8)</a>.  You can frost German Chocolate cakes, but we also now add a container to boxed brownie mix to make a gooey 9x13 treat.  We also add a container to a butter pecan boxed cake mix to make a bundt cake that is so elegant and tasty.  You can find recipes everywhere for those two desserts and they are SO worth trying!<br /><br />This 8-pack is a little pricey, but if you live out in the country or can't find this frosting in your store it is worth buying here.  (Also, if you don't have Amazon Prime, get it for bulkier items like this that are otherwise too expensive to ship.)"
