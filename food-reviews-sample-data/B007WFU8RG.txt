A1ZGCQ2XHJE9YO	5	Good Stuff...	2	2	I recently purchased a can of Koma Unwind from a local convenience store out of curiosity and loved it. I deal with a lot of stress in my life. I have a large family with several family members that have significant mental health issues. I found myself consuming alcoholic beverages to help me unwind and go to sleep at night. After trying Koma Unwind I've completely cut out the alcohol. I get to sleep faster, am better rested and have the benefit of reducing my caloric intake. I've tried both the regular and sugar free and find them both equally as enjoyable (sticking with the sugar free so I can cut out the calories). Not sure if the description mentions it but the product also contains Milk Thistle which is supposed to help improve liver function. I would describe the effects as something similar to taking a Valium but smoother and for me more pleasant.

In my opinion, Koma Unwind is a definite 9 out of 5 stars. The product description says it all. Drinking one can of this allows your body to relax from your head to your toes (and I mean your toes!). You will feel your whole body reach a state of tranquility, while your mind is at a standstill, allowing your natural tiredness to take over. I haven't slept this well since who knows! This product surprised me so much, I actually bought stock in their company. I definitely recommend this to everyone! Now quit reading and add this to your cart!!!
