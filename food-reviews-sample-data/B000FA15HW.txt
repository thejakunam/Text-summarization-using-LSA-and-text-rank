A1LHZTIR2RBNSB	5	Hard to find Deli-Rye Triscuits now available on Amazon.com	5	5	I really enjoyed the Deli-rye Triscuits when they were offered in the Evansville, IN<br />market many years ago.  Unfortunately they no longer carry this product in our grocery<br />stores. On visiting a friend in Cincinnati, OH I discovered them on the shelves at a<br />Kroger store. Naturally I was elated with joy. I bought several boxes to take home.  This was the closest area that<br />I could find that carries them.<br /><br />  I did a search on the Internet for the Deli-rye Triscuits and to my surprise found<br />them available on Amazon.com. Now I don't have to drive four hours to get them.  Amazon.com can have them<br />delivered right to your front door.  They come 12 to a box so I can share them with<br />my friends and relatives. They can't wait until my shipment comes in.<br /><br />  The Deli-rye Triscuits have a great rye taste that makes for a great compliment to any<br />kind of spread or topping.  I like them with shaved ham and swiss cheese.  I also like to melt<br />Monterey Jack cheese on them for a hot snack. For a special treat, try them with smoked salmon, cream cheese, and<br />fresh dill.<br /><br />  Thanks Amazon.com for making them available so that everyone can enjoy them.<br />  Duane in Evansville, IN
A7UD5961JJABL	5	Love that rye  and carraway seed flavor!!	3	3	These are the best Triscuit Nabisco makes! I can't understand why they are so hard to find in stores! I'm just thankful Amazon offers them with free shipping. A friend & I split the order because we both love them. A very healthy and tasty snack!
A1KVWIKFMDK1B2	5	I Love Rye Triscuits	2	2	I was very dissapointed when Nabisco discontinued selling Rye Triscuits in the stores.  The Rye flavor is the best and the other funky flavors that are on the shelf aren't worth buying.  I was so happy I found them for sale on Amazon.

A3RUCQZ1OXK3BB	5	Now you can get Deli Style Rye Triscuits in Utah!	1	1	I love the Deli Style Rye Trisuits, but you can't get them in Utah (What?  Don't the mormons alow that either?).  I love that I can get them on Amazon.  For any of you Utahns who want to try a really good, healthy cracker, try them!  Also, my favorite Campbell's soup (Fiesta Chili) you can't get in Utah, but you can get on Amazon.

THEY GO GREAT WITH ANYTHING AND ONCE YOU TASTE THEM, YOU WILL BE HOOKED ON THEM, TO ABANDON ALL OTHERS! BE AWARE THAT THESE ARE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE IN MASSACHUSETTS. THEY CAN BE BOUGHT IN STORES IN NYC, FLORIDA AND MAINE. I HAVE NOT FOUND THEM ANYWHERE ELSE, THUS ORDERED ONLINE! I HAVE EVEN CONTACTED NABISCO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO CHANGE ""MARKETS""."
