A2U84A32KQTVL2	4	Premium Oolong Tea	11	11	Prince of Tea brand teas are great. The premium oolong tea is good, but I found that I like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium, and it generally costs less too. Prince of Tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and you'll do well to buy their products.
A2MOJANFPX353G	5	Excellent Tea, Good Price	8	8	I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken
A1PBO90FMY86D6	5	Great product	8	8	I drink three cups of this each day, made with one Oolong tea bag and one green tea bag, in a large mug.  I believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs. in the last five months.  I drink it without sweeteners, and also cold. The price for this is very reasonable, and the taste is mild.

AZFFSBRIADPM0	5	Great Tea	4	4	I have been drinking oolong tea for several months now. I find it quite a nice morning beverage instead of coffee. It is also a great pick me up in the afternoon. One of the benefits of oolong tea is increased energy, which for me it works. This oolong tea is great tasting and light flavored. I will definitely continue to purchase it.
AAYEMQQIFBA2J	5	Very good tea!	3	3	The tea tastes great hot or iced.  Very good for the price.  I recieved the package fast with no problems.
A2OAYU1SUQC94X	3	Using because Dr Oz said	0	0	I'm drinking oolong tea because Dr Oz said it would raise metabolism, the jury is still out.......really how would you know? I have lost weight but that's because I quit drinking coffee which I added too much cream to and started working out a lot more. It does not taste the all that great so I add 3 equals and drink it after it cools.
A385HIX12YXQ5	5	"A definite ""yes!"" product"	0	0	Superior flavor, not too green, not too black. Loved it from the first cup.I put a hint of Splenda/Sugar blend in mine and am substituting it for coffee these days. Stumbled on it in  a shop but will be getting it thru Amazon in the future. I am here now because after tasting it I wanted to be sure I could buy it on line and have it delivered to the door. Again, a definite yes product! maggiemay
