AKLGTLUAKVVFB	3	It was nearly very good	3	3	"Nostalgia ruled and from far away I ordered a selection of all my childhood memories; Bakewell Tarts, Crunchies, Aeros, Maltesers, Cadbury Flakes,Fray Bentos Steak & Kidney Pies, Kendal Mint Cake....and Mr Kipling Lemon Slices.<br /><br />All went well to start with; the order was confirmed and the goods delivered on schedule to the courier service in the USA that was to relay them on to me in Latin America and then, within days, they arrived to my impatient arms. So far so good, but not for too long.<br /><br />The chocolate goods provided the first signs of trouble. You know the problem, the chocolate colour had changed to a milky white and the chocolate flavour insipid to say the least. Was this a sign the chocolate products were old, or was it the result of delivery problems (bad packaging)? Difficult to say, but examination of the other products suggested an answer to this question.<br /><br />On looking more closely I noticed the expiry date for the Lemon Slices had already expired 10 days ago by the time I received them. Much the same for the Bakewell Tarts which had also expired 4 days later. Opting for the most urgent priority I quickly gobbled the Lemon Slices and, to my surprise, found them highly acceptable, my childhood memories reassured. I may suffer tomorrow from an overdose of Lemon Slices, we shall see, and then afterwards an attack on the Bakewell Tarts.<br /><br />But I really do think more attention should be given to the ""expiry dates"", especially in the case of long distance deliveries."
