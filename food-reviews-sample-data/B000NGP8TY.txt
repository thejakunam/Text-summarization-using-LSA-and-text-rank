ADUBL0AIOCBH3	5	Best Rockstar on the market	5	5	Exactly what I need mid afternoon. This is the best tasting of the low carb sugar free energy drinks out there.
AGVPGATH8XA5P	4	Rock until they drop...	3	3	With the subscription program I have these delivered once a month.  I can rock until they drop... them at my door.
A39650P2CZUUC9	5	Great Afternoon Pick-Me-Up	1	1	I love Rockstar energy drink.  Even though it has hardly any calories, it does not taste like it is artificially sweetened.  It gives me a nice afternoon pick-me-up and I love the fruity taste.  The drink is augmented with ginseng, guarana, B vitamins, and other good stuff.  While it's probably not the healthiest drink on the market, I love the taste.  I'm one of those people who can't drink water and need to find other sources for hydration especially since I live in Florida where it's very hot.  Rockstar and Blackberry Ice are my drinks of choice.
A28ELEMNR1EB13	5	Great for diabetics	1	1	Being a type 1 diabetic I can't have the regular energy drinks with the insane amount of sugar and carbs, and for a while I've been trying to find a diet alternative that works and I've finally found it with these Zero Carb Rockstars. It doesn't impact my blood sugar, it tastes good, and wakes me up like an energy drink should plus these 24 packs save me a ton of time and money.
A2A2KQCSB35U9	5	Love..love..love...love these Rockstars	1	1	My husband drinks these every morning (he doesn't like coffee) so getting these delivered to our front door with free shipping is AWESOME! Save us money too cause it keeps him out of the stores in the morning where usually he is tempted to buy other stuff like junk food!
A46GQN01XAB47	5	Zero Carb = BEST	3	4	As I work nights, I've tried almost EVERY energy drink out there. They usually taste like vitamin-y candy.<br />This is the best (besides Juiced Guava... Less calories. When you drink 2 a night, that adds up).<br />As I sit here, sipping the lovely purple liquid, I contemplate how to describe the flavor. Sweet, hint of fruity? I dunno, but it's VERY enjoyable. I visit 7-11 nightly, was all bummed out because they were out. Got Monster instead and whined at my 7-11 guy. He told me to put the Moster back and went and grabbed me some from his stash in the back. What a winner!! :-)<br />I like RockStar Zero Carb (blue can) WAY more than Redbull or Bawls. Though I do enjoy Monster's HitMan energy shots, though too much caffiene too fast. Prefer to slowly consume throughout my shift....<br />Hope this helps someone.
A2TRU7HURHTFX6	5	ROCKSTAR	3	4	They say this is an energy drink. It has a lot of minerals in it but I just drink it for the taste. Somehow it really refreshes my thirst. It's hard to find and not cheap but it's a 16 oz. can so you get a lot for the money. Ilove the taste. I have no more energy than with any sugar drink and I've heard a lot of tall tales about these drinks. Just drink it if you like a well flavored drink. It's good.
AFW7TX0B0IXY3	5	Best tasting energy drink out there	5	7	I was buying this from the companies site---don't its cheaper on Amazon...
A9L9IYLEJO9JX	2	Bad Packaging! One Short!	2	3	We were expecting a case... but no - we got 23 cans thrown recklessly in a box that arrived with a hole in it - some of the cans were dented! Will not be making this purchase again unless we can be assured this will not happen again.
A3RFRY03BR3K6K	5	It's my go juice!	2	3	I love, love, love Diet Rock Star.  I think it's, by far, the best tasting diet energy drink out there.  I drink one every morning instead of coffee and I call it my Go Juice.  If you do subscribe and save it's significantly cheaper.
A2AMZRQLO1N55X	4	works for me!	2	3	having one with or after lunch totally eliminates the urge to find a quiet niche and cut a few zzzzz's.  i have a large capacity for caffeine so rockstar does not make me jumpy at all...just eliminates the drowsys.  the flavor may be an acquired taste but could be worse.  a small price to pay for the buzz.
A1HN0WW8H4MYC6	5	The king of energy drinks!	0	0	"I started drinking Monsters in high school, usually one or more a day. I tried Red Bull, Nos, Amp, Rockstar, and tons of other varieties, but it wasn't until I found Rockstar Zero Carb that I discovered one I really liked. I normally hate things that are ambiguously flavoured ""wild berry"" or something similar, and I don't usually enjoy diet beverages. Rockstar Zero Carb is the exception to this rule. I'm in my 20s now, and I don't drink energy drinks every day, but when I do drink them, this is the kind I prefer.<br /><br />As a side note - this packs in a lot more ""energy"" ingredients than most energy drinks, and I've always felt that I absorb them better without the carbs. And if for some reason you have no sense of self-preservation and drink four or even five of these beasts in a single night, you don't have to worry about all the awful sugar you'd get in the non-sugarfree version."
ABOD2CGMINXTL	5	energy	0	0	These are awesome and I love buying in bulk. MY boyfriend has one before work everyday because he works third shift but has classes during the day. I found it cheaper to do this so I bought a couple 24 packs. These did not last long between the two of us. They taste wonderful but are a lot of caffeine. If you don't drink it normally Id NOT suggest these! My friend tried one and could not finish it. She felt sick the entire rest of the day because she never drinks caffeine. I routinely drink it and have since I was young. These cans are wonderful for me to take in my lunch to college classes and help me keep up between class, clinical, working and homework! Plus 20 calories for a whole can? Who can beat that?
A3JS4HZHL8SXNZ	3	Like Battery Acid	0	0	(This review is for the white can with the gold star)<br /><br />I imagine if I were to break open a battery and empty the contents into my mouth, this is exactly how it would taste and feel. It's brutal. I can't really describe it. It tastes sort of... pineapple-y? With a hint of dirty socks and metal...?<br /><br />But it has a lot of good stuff in it and really wakes me up. But the blueberry flavor (blue and white can) is 100x better.<br /><br />If you want a sugar free energy drink, get the diet Red Bulls. I can hardly taste the difference with those. But these are okay sometimes and WAY cheaper.
A23DW8M4VLLWBX	1	Missing items	0	0	I only received 19 cans when I paid for 24. Also, two cans were busted. I am $10 short from this order.
A3VQ1FXE3AZWKT	5	For those of us that don't like coffee	0	0	I am the type of person who needs a caffeine rush in the morning in order to make it through the day. Unfortunately, I can't stand the taste of coffee.<br /><br />When energy drinks entered the market, I tried them out but couldn't stand the taste of all the sugar. Once Rockstar released a sugar free energy drink, I was hooked from the start. It doesn't have a flat taste like all other sugar free drinks do, this one will give you a pop when you take your first swig.<br /><br />Price is pretty completive, though you can find them cheaper if you hunt around. Some convenience stores will sell them  2 for $3, making them a better deal. But you have to drive around and find a place that has them on sale, so I think paying the extra 20 cents or so on here is worth it.
A3W1FC8BB46T71	5	rockstar	0	0	Love the taste, esp at this price. Cheaper than at the store, and it comes to the door. I don't have to carry and put in the car.
ARYSDAZNRXN6G	1	Diet version had awful taste.......	0	0	I picked up a can of the sugar free Rock Star today. I was dying of thirst so when I opened it, I took a big chug of it. About halfway through swallowing it, the taste hit me, and I wanted to spit it all back out right away!<br /><br />WHAT! THE! What *is* that disgusting taste? It was like chewing a big wad of Hubba Bubba, then drinking some nasty strawberry soda mixed with Code Red Mountain Dew and a baby aspirin all at once. After the first drink, I was still thirsty so I braved another swallow and I ended up just opening the car door and dumping the whole can out right then and there. It made me GAG trying to choke this hideous concoction down! What a waste of money.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of energy drinks to begin with, but I've never !!IN MY LIFE!! tasted one this gross. It even smelled like CAT PEE.
A2FXDBTZP0JEKJ	5	Productivity juice	0	0	Really perks me up and helps me be more focused and productive. 0 calories and actually tastes decent. (I can't stand Red Bull!)
A1ADTIFAVF32ZE	3	If youre looking for taste this is not it	0	0	If you want an energy drink that tastes good this is not it. This stuff tastes like detergent with bleach flavor, and has the unpleasant aftertaste of artificial sweeteners. However it has the highest caffeine content per can of any other energy drink ive seen, and it surely gets the job done if you need to stay awake after a night of no sleep. Also, it is cheaper per volume then other energy drinks.
A595T15OO91DC	5	It's about the caffeine!	0	0	240 MG of caffeine, no sugar crash, no calories to fill you up.<br /><br />Not sure why people say it tastes bad or perhaps it's my brain telling my taste buds that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />As for the price, two cups of gas station coffee (well, maybe truck stop coffee...) or one small cup of Starbucks coffee will give you the same jolt for about the same price.  Take your pick.<br /><br />Besides, do we really drink these things for the taste?
ADW081L1HVGR5	4	One time Great Deal	0	0	First time I bought this on-line it was a Great Deal, second time the price was<br />more than $10.00 higher.Much cheaper in store but first time was the best!
A13SFAXX6PAV3L	5	By far the best energy drink!	0	0	"I have tried a number of energy drinks in my day, and Rockstar's Low Carb is the best. Low calories, tasty, no ""fake sugar"" aftertaste, and a nice boost. $44 for 24 cans with free shipping is pretty good here on Amazon (approximately $1.83 a can), but I prefer to get it on sale at Target in 4 packs for $6 ($1.50 per can). The only downside is that it's hard to find sometimes!"
A30G1IEX9KHMBB	4	ROCKSTAR REVIEW	0	0	ITEM WAS AWESOME. SHIPPING WAS FREE SO IT WAS EVEN BETTER. ITEM WAS SHIPPED PROPERLY AND FAST!!! A+++ THANKS AGAIN. ONLY WISH THE COST COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CHEAPER BUT OVERALL PRODUCT ROCKED!!! THANKS!
A3JHGIIRW1UUPL	5	Works for me	0	0	This drink does what I need it to do and does it fast.<br />Taste is good and the boost I get is good.<br />Highly recommended.
AX7R1L5I6XL2X	5	Best tasting energy drink out there	0	0	Love this stuff!!! I order a case every month and drink one everyday on my way home from work. It gives me the boost I need to come home after a long day and get in an intense workout/run. As for taste....FANTASTIC :)
AK5ZE0E8MQE9G	5	Excellent Flavor	0	0	Glad to see that Amazon carries Rockstar Energy Drinks. Personally, I enjoy this flavor compared to the other Rockstar and energy drinks. It has a great flavor and definitely boosts my energy! This one in particular is hard to find in stores and I am glad that this can be purchased with Free Shipping and have it delivered to my door. Try this out, you won't regret it!
A24DCVFQ1XXY9Y	5	Tastes Great!	3	5	This one has the perfect combination of great taste and lots of energy.  My favorite!
A168JB7B8H3X9I	5	Best energy drink on the market - hands down	1	2	What is there to say but this is clearly the best tasting, hardest hitting energy drink on the market today.  I have tried all the flavors but there is nothing topping the original.  I just wish Amazon carried the 24oz versions!
A3NVC90KJEP0G1	5	Amazing taste	1	2	The taste is amazing. I can no longer find in stores, it seems maybe discontinued which is a shame but thankfully still sold here... for now at least.<br /><br />The picture of the can above is not of this flavor, the guava one is the purple color, but have no worries when you order you get the guava drink.<br /><br />I don't know if the energy is as strong in the guava as other energy drinks, I feel it is weaker, but this one in my opinion is the best tasting.
A2W0O92FZFHJOJ	4	Great Taste and Energy, Buuuut. . .	1	2	I ADORE this drink! It's the next best thing to coffee in the morning (though a lot of people's stomachs probaby handle that . . .But I'm a college student and coffee here is EXPENSIVE!).Heck! It's good for anytime of the day (well . .you may want to avoid drinking it after 6 or so if you want a decent sleep (unless you have to cram for a test or whatever) . .I've only had the original (citrus) kind though . ..I'm kind of curious about the others . . .<br /><br />Anyway, what dissapoints me is the shipping cost . .What the heck!? $20!!??!! That's almost the same amount as the drinks themselves! . . .and here I thought I was getting an uber great deal (it's still cheaper here by a little bit though so I guess I can't complain too much . . .)
A2H8W75COHT7P5	5	Lasting Energy	1	2	I feel that Rockstar gives a more even energy high for a loger period of time then the other energy drinks out there.  Also, Amazon's free shipping, no tax and no shipping makes it a deal.
AJNMTVFKSX42T	5	The best energy drink around	1	2	This is by far my favorite energy drink.  It is easily the best tasting diet with a pleasant berry flavor and has a nice kick that doesn't lead to a crash like a full sugar drink can.<br /><br />I switched to a Rockstar in the morning instead of coffee and absolutely love it.
A33PF94MA9LH11	5	Tastes great and makes for a fun night out	1	2	I am the type of person who gets tired and starts yawning when I am out at a bar... that is untill I discovered Rock Star.  This one is my favorite flavor, but they all get the job done.  I am a much more fun person with half a rockstar in me, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to keep themselves a bit more awake late at night.
A31ATJR2RAVD5G	5	Doesn't taste like toothpaste or cough syrup. All right.	0	1	By the grace of God, unlike Monster or almost any energy drink (including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not-so-happy side-effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it's a freaking rash on your face), this actually tastes palatable. In my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots, they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and/or cough syrup. Not only are they disgusting beyond words and are insanely unpleasant to drink for seemingly no good reason, but they almost always have very little of the single ingredient that matters: Caffeine. Any half-educated energy drink consumer knows this is the only ingredient in the entire thing that actually does anything at all. There's 240mg per can in these, versus the usual 120mg (about the same amount of a standard cup of coffee) in other drinks of the same size, which is just not enough for people like me.<br /><br />This stuff actually tastes like a genuine raspberry soda, has a decent kick, and doesn't taste as horrible as anything Monster has ever made or any of the even more unpleasant energy shots that taste identical to concentrated cough syrup, which then, for seemingly almost everyone, give you a blast of Niacin so insanely high that it even warns you of it ahead of time, and by God, if it lasted more than a few minutes, you'd think you'd need an ambulance. And you pay a *lot* for those suckers.<br /><br />This is really the way to go. It tastes good and has a lot of caffeine, and lacks the bad things most energy drinks have. Since that's really all that matters, I highly recommend it. It never seems to get old.
A1WMCX4CYZCYXE	2	Tastes like Grape Flinstones Chewable Vitamins	0	1	This is for the white can Rock Star. While drinkable, this drink has a chalky aftertaste and a fairly wretched flintsones grape vitamin taste. If you like chewable flintstones grape vitamins and a chalky aftertaste, you'll love Rockstar Zero Carb Energy Drink.<br /><br />Not to my taste.
AC6O7RG7C7JHL	3	Good, and Bad	0	1	"Before I largely stopped drinking energy drinks, these were two of the products i drank a lot of.<br /><br />Overall pros: cheaper than redbull<br />Overall cons: still an expensive habit<br /><br />BLUE CAN, 4 stars:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Interesting/good taste.  It has a very, very fruity taste, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other energy drinks, but could kind of become too sweet/overpowering when I drank too many of these.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Compared to other energy drinks, I do not think that this goes well with alcohol (vodka) at all.  So for normal usage, it's a solid drink, for a redbull/vodka substitute, this wasn't it, for me.<br /><br />WHITE CAN, 2 stars:<br /><br />Pros: Most tolerable when mixed with alcohol.<br /><br />Cons: This is the drink that i think has the most stereotypical awful energy drink/diet taste compared to anything else i've ever had.  It just tastes so artificial and chemical-like.  Why did I even buy this drink in the first place? for a while, it was the only diet energy drink in my university's cafeteria.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I drank hundreds of these over the past 5 or so years until finally pretty much kicking my energy drink habit and switching to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A"">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>.  I kind of miss drinking energy drinks, but 30 cents/pill vs. $2+ per drink was worth it for me... and I'll still splurge on a Lo-Carb Monster occasionally."
A1CRNCZBDN7V70	5	Best price on a hard to find product	0	1	It is getting harder and harder to find the Zero Carb Rock Star in our local area so I started ordering from Amazon.  I now pay less per can and it's delivered to me.  LOVE IT!!
A16S1X00JD3TLE	5	Amazon Rocks!	0	1	Caffeine isn't an upper for me, but it's a nice calmative beverage.  I can't have sugar.  So I enjoy sugar free energy drinks.  Rockstar Zero-Carb has a nice berry tea flavor too it.  It's a flavor I can live with, unlike a lot of other drinks.  I can't tell you about the buzz level, since I don't get a buzz, but a can of this will completely knock out any caffeine headache...LOL.  It's got more caff than the Sugar Free.<br /><br />Individual cans are not cost effective.  I was having trouble finding a lot of sugar free energy drinks in my area, and when I did, the prices were high.  I was thrilled to find Amazon had them at good prices... WITH FREE SHIPPING!?!?  Holy cow!  I can get a heavy case of soda shipped to my door for nada?  Now that REALLY rocks!  I don't know how they do it.  The first one came FedEx..LOL.  For free.  And fast, too!<br /><br />I've been an Amazon customer since... yikes, I don't remember the year.  Pretty much since they first opened.  Back when they used to send all their customers Christmas gifts.<br /><br />Rock on!
A2YWEG35UMPBJ3	5	Great drink	0	1	At times I wish this weren't an energy drink because I love the way it tastes and I'd like to drink it without the energy effects such as at night. I'm also sure it would be less expensive if it weren't marketed as an energy drink. In any case, I love the taste and it gets me going in the morning sometimes when I'm dragging. It's certainly the best tasting energy drink I've had. If you've tried the non-juiced Rockstar drinks, don't judge this by those. They taste nasty by comparison.
A2LM20PDQ4WG9H	1	Bait and switch!	6	11	Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.
AXBFG327374DO	1	10%!?	6	11	I used to love the 70% rockstar juiced. When it changed to 50% I was disappointed, but it was still satisfying; definitely the best tasting energy drink on the market. The new 10% tatses like they simply replaced the juice with sugar water and citric acid. Terrible. I'm done with rockstar as soon as the stores run out of the 50% stuff.
A30V7DH4P4TJOS	5	Party Like a RockStar	1	3	Rockstar Zero is great for when you need an extra boost without the jitters and the sugar. Purchasing a case of Rockstar through Amazon saved me time and money. Rockstar Zero is hard to find and is also expensive. This is the best deal by far.
A1MTNU1YITYMSR	5	Best 0 Carb Energy  Drink Out There	1	3	I have tried a bunch of the diet and lo carb energy drinks on the market. Most are too sweet or have a funky taste. Rockstar has a light berry flavor with not too much carbonation. It does not leave an after taste and gives me the same energy boost as any of the others.
A4B3AF0RAC2N4	5	Drink for the taste too	1	3	I'm very skeptical about energy drinks, mostly because of a possible caffeine addiction. I haven't tried too many (never tried Red Bull, so really...not that many :p), but this one is great. Granted, there is a lot of sugar in it (40ish grams) PLUS artificial sweetner to make a really sweet drink. But I like the taste, and I too find it refreshing. I drink Juiced Guava maybe once a week to enjoy and it perks me up but not as much as coffee does to the point I get jittery.
A3AG5B0TQMUBQI	5	The BEST deal on Rockstar Drinks!	1	3	"Dear Amazon,<br />Thank you very much for the order of Rockstar Drinks that I had ordered! Rockstar is my favorite drink and I was sooooo HAPPY to find it on Amazon for a very cheap price! I couldn't believe it! The Shipping was very fast and the drinks were great and between my Husband and I, were gone within five days! It was exceptional service and exceptional price! I would DEFINITELY order my Rockstars from Amazon again!!! Thank you!! ;)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NGP8TE"">Rockstar Energy Drink, 16 Ounce Can (Pack of 24)</a>"
A17YYBEVOR2MWE	1	WHAT IS WRONG WITH ROCKSTAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	4	8	Ya for 10% juice rockstar......NOT<br /><br />I just had one of these new 10% juice version and they taste like crap, WTF is wrong with rockstar why change something that was so good to something that tastes like crap now..... goodbye my beloved 50% juice untill you return (if ever) I shall miss you. oh and circulation just hit my area with this crap.
A1LIM4V7Q6LJJJ	1	New formula is absurd!	2	5	When I found out Rockstar Juiced recently changed its formula to 10% juice, I was heartbroken. I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version. But once they are completely out, goodbye Rockstar Juiced. I will miss you.
ASSEO964U0VI7	1	New reduced juices from 70 to 50% and now 10% YUK!	3	7	We drank the new reduced juice unknowingly and thought yuk what's up with this did we get a bad batch? I searched the new can, knowing it appeared simular but could not find the 10% as it was cleverly hidden in the back. I then went to my recycle bin for an old can and compared. No longer proudly displayed on the front 50% real juice. I have justified this expensive,tasty and addictive treat for years and alloted 1 per family member per day. Now this case is going back and we are done with Rockstar until they bring back the higher real juice formula. I even had a stomach reaction to this one and I tend to have a goat gut. Bad taste bad product change and pissed that they reduce the juice keeping the price the same 2-3.00 per can, another misguided by greed rogue corporation. Now I cannot help but wonder if that blogger that rants that Rockstar is owned by Nazi's has some credibility. My wife really resented the fact that the new packaging was predominently identical to the old decieving her into purchasing a product she did not want or like.Back it all goes.
AJ4EUJTPKEQ0W	1	50% to 10% Juice? New Rockstar Juiced Fails to Rock	0	2	Been drinking Rockstar Juiced since it came out. I hardly noticed the 70% to 50% change in their formula, but the new 10% forumla is horrible.  Where Rockstar was once the best energy drink out there, this change in formula will easily put the other energy drinks with juice on top. Hope Rockstar sales plummit and they can see their mistake and make the change now.
AZFYB8QVKT3AS	5	Wow, was that chick on the video high?	0	2	Ok, besides the really FAR OUT review of the Rockstar Juiced Mango being trippy, but the juice you get, and the JUICE you get do not make you act like that, but a REALLY GREAT ENERGY DRINK none the less!!! More sales on it would be awesome!
A1GQMKO3FN9M6I	5	Rockstars...ummm...rock?	0	2	Actually, I work third shift and its these bad boys that keep me going most of the time. They're pretty addictive though if you like the taste, which is certainly not for everyone. I'd definitely try it out from a local grocery store before shipping yourself a whole 24 pack of them. It also comes in Diet, Guava, and Juiced, of which I personally only like the guava one.
AV9Y3O7QVT0Q4	1	10%??!?!?!?! how wrong is that????	4	9	ok, I must have missed out on some kind of product review or something.... becuase I would never have agreed to this change in rockstars juiced drinks. I had one today for the first time and all I can say is DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Thanks for killing the one engery drink I actaully liked!!!<br /><br />I hope rockstar thinks again really soon, becuase as of this moment I am off the soft drink band wagon.
A2CVO0IO47FLC	5	Quite possibly the greatest drink ever!	2	6	"I bought this back a while ago, and I'm still reaping the benefits of drinking this miraculous beverage.  I feel more alert, my social life has improved, and my urine has a wonderful neon yellow hue.<br /><br />Even though it is sealed quite nicely in it's case, after you are able to remove the can, you may want to cool down your energy drink.  My preference was to put the cans in my refrigerator, but you could get a similar effect by setting the cans in a snow bank, or by using ice cubes in a glass to cool the drink down.  My first problem came when I was ready to drink the Diet Rockstar(tm).  I looked at the can and was perplexed as to how to open it up, until I noticed this clever ""tab"" at the top that would pop open a perfect sized drinking hole to use.<br /><br />Once I opened it up, I quickly poured the entire contents of the Diet Rockstar(tm) into my mouth and then swallowed it.  I had heard of people not caring for the last few drops of a warmed can, so I figured that it would be best to drink it before it had the opportunity to warm up.  What a great decision that was!  Shortly afterwards I felt a burst of energy surge through my body and I was more productive then I have ever been in my life.  Normally I would take a 8:30am nap at work, but not today.  Was was ready to work and to get everything completed in a orderly fashion.  However, a problem soon surfaced as there was no more work to do for a few hours and I had all this energy to burn off.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and would suggest that everyone purchase as much as you can.  This drink will change your life and make you complete all of your activities with ease."
A15VKKP1HRN5TY	1	Rockstar Juiced is a joke now!	0	3	I used to buy these everyday! [sometimes twice], but since they changed the contents to merely water and artificial crap! I dont buy at all!!!They taste terrible now............ WHERE'S THE JUICE !
A20X1WRPHAMF6B	1	Buy directly for waaay cheaper	3	9	If you live in the continental US, you can by most (all?) of Rockstar's 16oz cans, in 24-can packs, for $48 WITH FREE SHIPPING.
A2AF8V41IQ97EM	2	Shipping costs	0	4	Thought I was buying direct from Amazon, but wasn't.  Product was fine, shipping took longer than expected, and shipping costs nearly doubled the price.  I will be much more careful on ordering from Amazon, not just ordering through Amazon, in the future.
