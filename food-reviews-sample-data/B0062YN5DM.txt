A3R4794K2RVU1S	5	Good value - Our Labrador pup loves likes them	1	1	These pork chomps mini knotz are of very good value. For the 21 count, I purchased it for $10. Other products with similar size and weight was in the $20 range.<br /><br />Our Labrador pup likes these bones and definitely keeps her occupied. Give it as a treat or hide it, either way it keeps them busy.<br /><br />The knotz are about 2 - 3 inches in length and about half an inch wide. The size varies, but that's the rough size of the bones.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the product. If my dog could, she would say so too.

A2G7CZCAA2XLKN	5	little treats for little dogs	0	0	I have 2 small chiwienees who love these.  I've tried many different kinds for them and this is their favorite.  Seems to be a consistent product that has never made them sick.  They love them, and I'm glad there's no mess left behind.  Not greasy, and nothing remains when they are done with them.
