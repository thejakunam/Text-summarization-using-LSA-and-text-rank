AKY1YTYZNP1VM	5	My absolute favorite!!!	1	1	I originally received this coffee as a gift from a co-worker, and  I became addicted!!! It makes my house smell amazing in the morning when it's brewing, and it is by far the best tasting coffee I've ever had! I drink coffee every day, and I look forward to starting my day with this stuff. :)
A8JQ2EH65VSRT	5	Great Flavored Coffee	1	1	I really enjoyed Green Mountain's seasonal coconut flavored brew but also put off that it's, well, seasonal.  So I began a search for a new flavored coffee and ended up ordering this.  The flavor is nice, subtle, and lingering.  The coffee itself seems somewhat uneven in grind, but using the Aeropress negates that.  Consider this my replacement.  Will order again!
A3SWCA2NEHRL0Z	5	Beautiful in your mouth	1	1	The Kauai Koloa Coconut Caramel Crunch is amazing. I drink a pot of coffee a day and I was getting bored of my usual name brands. I buy those little single pot bags every so often for a change and they're okay, but THIS is some amazing coffee that I will be buying more of when it comes back in stock. The aroma is so powerful and delicious that I can smell it on the other side of the house. It's not cloyingly sweet and doesn't taste artificial, with a crisp coffee flavor that simply hints at the coconut and caramel. One of the best cuppas I've ever had.<br /><br />UPDATE: Since I first reviewed this coffee, I've tried 8 different other brands and bought an 8-cup french press for brewing a pot and an aeropress for the one-cup pick-me-up. This is still far and away my favorite tasting coffee, EVER. It's even better in the two press brewers.<br /><br />My only problem is that this coffee doesn't come in a whole-bean or at least in a special grind for french press. Even so, you're missing out if you haven't tried this.
