A2P12PY8KREQXC	5	Great alternative to the Aspartame drink mixes out there.	2	2	Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy drinking just plain ol' water, but sometimes I desire a little flavor in my beverage, without added sugar.<br /><br />Having said that, I'm surprised that the powdered drink mixes I see at the grocery store are primarily sweetened with aspartame.  After all, Splenda/Sucralose has been out long enough to have made its way to these products.  I found this mix on Amazon and I'm quite pleased with it.  It's sweetened with Splenda, and it has none of the aftertaste often associated with aspartame.  It does indeed taste like fruit punch, with more of a cherry note to it, but very pleasant.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is that while each little tub makes 2 quarts of beverage per the instructions, I find that using two full quarts of water for one tub makes for a somewhat watered down taste, so I just adjust the amount of water down a bit (though not worth deducting stars).  That is a matter of taste, so of course experiment for yourself.<br /><br />This is a great product and I highly recommend it.

A2BGO838YJ2YO	5	Great product but priced too high on amazon.com	0	0	This is one of the few products that manages to LEAVE OUT the extra maltodextrin calories, aspartame, and sodium benzoate. But I can buy this for $4.00 per canister at Walmart.<br /><br />amazon.com needs to offer more competitive prices if I'm going to buy in bulk and wait for shipping.
