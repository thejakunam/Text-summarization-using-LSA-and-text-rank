As I am always on the lookout for a decent tasting vegetable stock or bouillion that isn't loaded with sodium or additives, I snatched a box of this ""unsalted"" veg. stock off the shelf in my local supermarket when I saw it. Then I noticed that the sodium content was 240 mg. per cup. I know that vegetables contain a certain amount of natural sodium--some more than others--but there's no way that THAT much sodium can be attributed to just the vegetables. A lot of companies lately have been sneaking salt into their products under the guise of ""Natural Flavor"" because technically, that's what salt is so they can get away with it. And since this product does contain ""Natural Flavor"" as one of it's ingredients, I'd bet the farm that's EXACTLY what they did."
A32N57TRZOWP81	5	great vegetable stock but cheaper at the market	1	1	Tried this when it went on sale for $1.00/box and kicking myself for not buying in quantity! I eat very little flesh food and this broth was a blessing in disguise for pressure cooking beans and other vegetarian fare. Unfortunately, Amazon is not competitive with the local supermarkets as I can drive about a mile and buy for $3.00.box.
