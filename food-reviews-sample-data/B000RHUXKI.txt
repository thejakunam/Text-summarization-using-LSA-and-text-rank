A21PYXS3L73OUL	5	Show Your Love. . .Make a Good Soup for Dinner!	0	0	My  family is a  big fan of soups and stews.  These Blackeye Peas (Beans) make a wonderful soup when you add ham with ham bone, finely chopped onion, finely chopped celery, lots of freshly ground pepper, and a bit of salt (to your taste). I also use Knorr Beef base to boil the ham w ham bone first. I also do a pan of cornbread made with Quaker corn meal. These beans do not have to be soaked overnight...a big plus.<br />The thing here is that all this can be done in a crock pot or on the stove top easily.  Blackeye peas (beans) are so very healthy  for you and your family.  Sometimes when I make vegetable soup I add about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of blackeye peas. I also add about the same amount of pearl barley.<br />Now, I am going to make a plea to all you good folks out there. Please start making your meals from scratch. Involve the kids.  All my soups and strews make great left overs or re-heated for the kids when they get home from school and sports.  This is not hard, OK?  It just takes a bit of planning and fore thought.  Let's all get healthy.  Let's cook and eat together again as families.  I know that your kids will love to cook with you as mine did.  I also taught them to bake. . .we started with my grandmother's great chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now both of my sons are married and approaching their 40's. In their own homes they both help a lot with the cooking, baking, and housework.  They also love camping, fishing, hunting, golf. . .and football.<br />I hope that you purchase these beans.  I love the packaging and the freshness. The quality is superb. My blessings go to each of you, your kitchens, and your families!
