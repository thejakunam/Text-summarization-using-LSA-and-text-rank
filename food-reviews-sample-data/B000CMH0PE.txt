A36B4WXFH2LISD	4	Refreshing afternoon or evening tea	2	2	For me, this is not a morning tea but it's a nice digestive in the afternoon, after a meal, or a much needed pick-me-up in the evening. I'll save you'll the explanation of why ginger is good for digestion - you can easily find a lot more info on this online.<br /><br />If you haven't tried Ginger tea before I suggest making some at home to try and only buying this if you're satisfied with the taste. It's really easy, just make green tea like you normally would along with about 1/8th of an inch of grated or chopped ginger root per cup, lastly add a few drops of lemon/lime juice when you're done steeping the tea.<br /><br />Alternatively, you may find this tea in your local grocery store in a single pack, which is a worthwhile investment before going for the 6-pack here on Amazon.<br /><br />When I am home I make it from scratch as described, I bought these tea bags to keep in the office or take with me when I travel. The ginger/lime combination is very refreshing and stays surprisingly potent for a packaged product.<br /><br />Overall, recommended but be warned that Ginger Green tea is an acquired taste and you will be disappointed if you are expecting a regular green tea.
