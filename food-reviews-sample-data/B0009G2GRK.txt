A265CHD37FPTCZ	5	Lucaffe - Easy and tasty	1	1	I have tried a number of different brands of espresso pods and really enjoy the Lucaffe. It is smooth and satisfying.  I use it when I don't have the time to grind my own espresso.  It is a quick and clean process.  No matter how much I try, I always make somewhat of a mess when I grind my own beans.  Making the Lucaffe is fast, clean, and easy... but most importantly, tasty.
A33GYL1LL646XK	4	Among the GOOD Ones	3	4	Let me qualify myself.  Been brewing espresso for about ten years.  Last five years using fairly high end equipment and superior beans ground for each cup.  Nearly all the time I make my espresso straight with a quarter tea spoon sugar and no milk.  Therefore my espresso reflects the flavor of the type of bean with a light softening of the bitterness by sugar.<br /><br />  All this experience indicates beans taste best immediately after roasting and/or opening a vacuum bag.  Taste and crema amount tapor off in the first week quite a bit.  Personal tastes may come to other conclusions but freshness makes a big difference.<br /><br />  Bought two fifty pod bags of espresso.  Among those the Lucaffe' Classic was better than most of the twenty five varieties (four each) I tasted.  Your taste might be different.  This Lucaffe' Classic is smoother, less bitter, and hints at some pleasant subtle flavors I found unique.<br /><br />  Perhaps more important than this particular pod expresso is the clear conclusion for me that pods produce much better espresso flavors than all my efforts to brew from freshly ground beans.  Clean up to a lot easier and each shot consistantly fresh due to the foil containers.  It is possible over time even the foil wrapping will not prevent loss of flavor I do not know.  There is no date on wrapped pods.<br /><br />  Bottom line:  Pod espresso is superior to grinding your own.  Freshness is more consistant.  Clean up is a LOT easier. Time from start to finish is much less.  Now I grind only for regular coffee.<br /><br />  IMPORTANT for POD brewing with my machine is plenty of warm up time for espresso machine which reduces amount of extraction in normal brew time of TWENTY TWO SECONDS plus or minus a few seconds.  Too short warm up can double ounces extracted in given time.  And it is possible that some brands of pods allow too much liquid to pass in twenty two seconds which is the standard time generally accepted.<br /><br />  Have you noticed these pods are the same concept as the Nespresso machines and other similar types?  However these pods offer more variety and more competition among suppliers can lead to lower prices if you buy the 150 pods size.<br /><br />  So why only four stars?  Some other pods taste slightly better to me.  I would give my own, from scratch, brews only three stars compared to pods who get four or five stars.
APYOBQE6M18AA	5	My Favorite Espresso	0	0	This is the third box of Lucaffe Classic I've bought.  All Lucaffe products are very good but this is my go to shot.  Good price and Super Saver shipping makes it all the better.
A70BSERKJY06N	5	A perfect blend!	0	0	This is my favorite ESE pod at an acceptable price.  The Lucaffe brand is my favorite.  I have also tried the Blucaffe Jamaican Blue blend and Mr. Exclusive, the pure Arabica serving.  They are all good but the Classic is tastier than the Mr. Exclusive, and I think definitely better than the Blucaffe considering the price.  This is a Robusta and Arabica blend, and very enjoyable.  Everyone that has tried it has been very impressed, and after drinking this, no one can stomache the Starbucks brand ESE pod.  Excellent crema, a subtle sweetness, and very rich.
