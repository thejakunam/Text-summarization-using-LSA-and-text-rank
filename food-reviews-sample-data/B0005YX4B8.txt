A2BMJDK9Y35AI5	2	Overpriced!	4	4	These cost $2.00 from the grocery store!  No reason to buy online if you have access to a grocery store...
A1HMCLZYZWERQI	5	Big price, yum taste	0	0	I love the flavor and don't have the patience for old fashioned grits which can take about 45 minutes to cook. This is the best option between the gross instant grits and the slow cook old fashioned. I like to eat them with a breakfast meat and cheese with a drop of butter.<br /><br />I must point out that anything more than about $2.99 for the 24oz is a bit steep. If you live state-side, check your local grocery store or Target/Walmart to find this product at a reasonable price. However, if you don't have convenient access to a general American grocery store (deployed, overseas, care package, etc.) then perhaps this price may be worth it.<br /><br />Never dissappointed with the taste, just the online price.
