AK0TWHMFVS41H	3	Good but not as good as the tea bag version	0	0	I bought this product because it appears that the teabag version of the Pixie mate chai (all of Pixie's teas actually) are no longer being made or sold and it was my favorite drink.  I do not particularly like things that are extremely sweetened so it has been difficult to find the right balance with this concentrate.  It is not bad, it is not great either.  It is extremely sweet as it has the sugar already in it.  The directions recommend mixing half concentrate with half milk and heating.  I found this to be overwhelmingly sweet and thick so I use 1/3 concentrate 2/3 almond milk (which is less sweet even than milk) and sometimes dilute with water a bit as well.  Note this does NOT taste good diluted with just water.<br /><br />If you like things that are very sweet you will love this.  If you find where they are still selling the teabag version please post!
