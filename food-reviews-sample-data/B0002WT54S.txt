AGZ2D1LGW5UBQ	5	Fantastic tea, too bad shipping is high	0	0	Found this tea in Maui and brought home two boxes; wish I'd brought back more. This is high-quality tea, well cured and grown, with a wonderful flavor. It's fantastic hot and delicious iced.<br /><br />If you love green tea, you'll love it.<br />If you've never had green tea, this is a great way to start without being overwhelmed by the strong green flavor.<br />And if you hate green tea, you'll like this one.<br /><br />If you're in HI on vacation, plan to purchase a few boxes -- it was only about $3/box at ABC, but is better than most of the $9/box brands on the mainland. Even with this high shipping cost, it's worth getting. It's that good.
