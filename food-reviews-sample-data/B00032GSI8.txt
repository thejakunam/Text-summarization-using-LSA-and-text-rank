A1KMO08LPL7Y18	4	I eat more veggies with this dip!	2	2	This is a handy product to have around if you're watching calories/carbs/fat.  I know I need to eat more vegetables, but usually don't.  Having this makes it fun and not drudgery.  Peppers, broccoli, anything tastes good in this dip.  I've given it as gifts to people wanting to modify their diet due to special events or changes in their health.  Recommended.
A1ZKBBOK1MOSOA	1	The only Walden Farms product that disappoints	1	1	I have been a fan of Walden Farms pancake syrup as well as their chocolate syrup and the jams.  So I had high hopes about their ranch dip.  UGH!  I'm sorry to have to say it, since their other products are great, but this was an unpleasant esperience.  The texture managed to be both slimy and clingy.  I thought the taste was particularly unpleasant and I threw the entire content away.  Kept the jar, though - Walden Farms uses nice glass jars!  So I am still a fan of theirs, and I will continue to buy other products from them, but NOT this one.
A1ANZ44X2ANS2M	5	Walden Farms product line is great	6	13	All of Walden Farms products are literally life savers. Not only are they fat free, sugar free, calorie free, carb free, etc. but they are absolutely deliciouse and at a reasonable price. I am on Nutrisystem now but am using Walden Farms products along with it and will continue with Walden Farms product line from now on. They offer healthy, tasty alternatives to everything you can imagine.
