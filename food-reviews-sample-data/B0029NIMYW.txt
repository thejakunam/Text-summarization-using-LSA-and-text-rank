A3UJ803WKQ5DC1	5	Cesar Canine Cusine (all flavors) 3.5 oz pkg	4	4	I started feeding this food (all flavors) to my senior Italian Grey when she stopped eating her dry food. I add 2oz of cooked rice to each feeding. She can't eat it fast enough.  I took a pkg to my vet and he looked up the analysis of it. He was surprised at the quality. He said it was excellent for a dog her age and that it was all right for me to continue feeding it to her. He had just completed a physical on her (fecal and blood work). Every area of the blood test was in the normal range. She's a happy, healthy dog. Before this I had to coax her to eat; Today, she demands to be fed and NOW!
A1B85T03FE5FOU	5	Only food my little dog will eat!!	3	3	Our little guy, who looks just like the one on the package!! loves this food.  He particularly likes these in the 'sauce'.  I have tried to switch him to less expensive canned foods over the past 3 years, and he just does not like them nearly as much and in many cases prefers to go hungry then eat Alpo or Purina cans.  I put this down on his little plate and it's gone in 2 minutes.<br />I don't know what the other lady is talking about-- I think she has this food mixed up with the Dog Whisperer's line -- mistake.  This is not his line at all.  Just a similar name.<br /><br />Get a subscription for this product and save some money.
A2WB9VCULDR27Q	5	Whatever's In Them, My Dogs Love 'Em!	5	6	Cesar Canine Cuisine Varety Pack Food Review<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />I was questionable about buying these at first, seeing that I'd be paying a dollar for an incredibly small meal my miniture dobermans would surely eat up in a minute. So I took a chance and bought the 12 pack-which includes Filet Mignon and Porterhouse Steak flavors-and my dogs ate them up! Yes, they did eat them fairly quickly, but I found that mixing two of the dinners and a big bowl full of dry food will still be tasty enough for them. Do that, and you'll get more use out of these-dogs seem to like their flavor. So although they aren't that healthy for dogs everyday (I made sure to read the inredients on the back), they're perfect for a snack or to mix with dinner.
A2VZNEM0V65R10	5	Great Price and My Dogs Love It!	2	2	I bought this from amazon because it is a great price.  Both of my dogs eat Cesar Cuisine for dinner.  Buying it from amazon means fast shipping and it arrives packaged great.  I have no complaints at all.  This dog food is the best for my dogs.  They love it and cannot wait for dinner to come each night.
A1AJQHK1UVW5J7	5	very good dog food	2	2	This is a good dog food for small dogs and a very good price.my dog loves it and it makes her coat really shine.It is great getting it dilivered.
A25FFOGVNY6NG2	5	I use this mixed with dry food	2	2	I divide these between my dogs, so they only get a little at a time and I water it down to make a kind of gravy. But they absolutely freaking LOVE this stuff. The ingredients are byproducts but you know what? My dogs will eat of the litter box if they get a chance, so I don't think this will harm them anymore than that would. Two Thumbs up from me!
A1QOSELPYNDHZ6	5	My dog loves it!	2	2	"I brought this food from a tripto New York and my dog just loves it, I guess she ""forgive me"" for leaving home just because I gave her this brand. The package is very convenient and easy to open."
AXP4BEHM4G83E	5	Cesar Dog Food	2	2	My dog, a toy poodle, is a very fussy eater.  He would rather starve than eat something he doesn't like.  He loves Cesar dog food!
A18Y7098R6WZTH	5	Two paws up!	1	1	My dog is a diabetic, and blind.  He's an older dog, and seemed to have lost his appetite for awhile.  This is the only food that he will eat without fail!  This is the best price out there, and I love the subscribe and save option!
AJ2OTSNC5QROO	5	Dogs love it	1	1	Better price than Dollar general by .10............ ............. ........ ........ ........ .......... ............ ........ ........ .............. ............ ......... ............. .............................
AVFUR3ATVLOWV	5	Only food my Shiz Tsu likes	1	1	My Shiz Tsu is very picky about what he eats. I have bought many brands of dog food, and he would rather go hungry than eat any of them. Then I tried Cesars and he loves it. So needless to say it is the only kind I buy anymore. So far he likes all the flavors he has tried.
A1I9HCI5ZJFHMU	5	Little Ceasars dog food	1	1	Ships promptly and in excellent condition. The containers are the right amount of food for my Shih Tzu.  The flavors come two in a package and are always fresh
A9DM85EPB0OR2	5	happy dog	1	1	my little min pin loves this dog food and it is the right size for her it is easy for her to eat
A1KG7TO6U7DW6Q	5	My little dog loves this food!	1	1	I have a 12 year old dog who weighs about 9 lbs and has very little teeth left. This is the only soft food I've found that he can eat. It's soft enough for him to grab, but not so soft that all the food gets stuck together in the bottom of the bowl. Highly recommended!!
A26GGDMNPTSDZO	5	CESAR DOG FOOD	1	1	i RECEIVED THE SHIPMENT IN GOOD CONDITION AND AM HAPPY FOR THE SPEEDY SHIPMENT. MY WIFES DOG GOES CRAZY OVER THIS STUFF, AND THAT IS A GOOD THING.<br />I DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT ELSE TO WRITE OVER WHAT EVERYONE ELSE KNOWS ALREADY, GOOD STUFF.
A34G124EDFPH7O	5	Picky Eater	1	1	My toy poodle loves this food and since setting it up on auto delivery I never have to worry about running out of food for him or trying to find his brand as I did in the past.  Great product and great service!
A247AEH9K2MJVY	5	the dog loves it	1	1	We have a minnie australian shepard and he loves this food and has been chowing it down for about three months now. One cautionary note though: the container says to serve 4 trays a day per 10 pounds of dog, which is way too much. We serve him 1/2 tray in the AM
A25H3YAY7XG1I1	4	cesar	1	1	This is a great product, small quatity therefore very costly, but my dog Rusty loves it the best of all foods.
A3UAY8VSSV46YV	5	My dogs favorite food	1	1	Even picky older dogs will gobble down this food. It is convenient to have it shipped in bulk.
AEMSR4TMYD2ZA	5	For the Snooty Dog	1	1	I have a miniature bichon frise and she will not eat anything else. Buying these seperately can get expensive - some places charge $1. per so the multipack is definitely the way to go.
AKXF7E64Z8CAK	5	A very hard to please little Poodle	1	1	I have a little toy Poodle and she is very hard to please when it comes to her food. I tried just about every brand of dog food I could find and she would not touch any of it... finally, I happened to pick up a pack of Cesar dog food and she loved it and it is all she will eat! Thanks, Cesar!
A1W9C4TZA5YCBL	2	little dogs love this ,but not daddy!	3	4	just look whats in it! not good  its like burger king for dogs! total garbage...
ANUUF3N6B9NTA	5	Cesar 24PK Dog Food	5	7	My Shih Tzu (Hampshire), Shihkanese (Darby), & Amer. Eskimo (London) absolutely love this dog food.  It's their special treat for when we travel both short & long distances.  My Vet calls it doggie McDonalds.  I get it at Sams Club for 16.98 + 6.5% tax--thought Amazon would be cheaper ($24.00, plus tax, & ship/hand)
A3N1XX8CQLSBZI	4	chow time	0	0	a fine delicacy, with a pleasant smell and taste  that my dogs look forward to. Packaging is easy to store and dispose
A1SMU8R3MET82B	5	Great Deal	0	0	We buy the 24 pack of these on monthly auto ship for our little doggies. Cheaper than buying at WinCo. Amazing bargain!
A298SSF2QOU7CV	5	ceasar dog food	0	0	My dog loves this food. It always arrives in a timely fashion. He gobbles it up as if he were starving.
A3EXIMIKYXLI6U	5	Excellent for Poodles	0	0	I have a very picky miniature poodle and she will only eat the Caesar Canine Cuisine: Porterhouse, T-Bone, Filet Mignon, Sirloin, and Grilled Chicken. She does not care for the last line Caesar's created; I have tried them. Keep in my, my vet said this is equivelant to a person eating at McDonalds every day. Sure, it has all the bad for you stuff, but an older dog can sometimes have a difficult time eating. I truly think any dog would love this!
AWUTHZ4Y13RHA	5	little dog continues to love this item	0	0	"We've been receiving Cesar Canine Cuisine Variety pack for several months now.. our little dog continues to eat it with gusto.  All I have to ask is...:"" Are you ready for dinner?"" and she's waiting impatiently in the kitchen for me to set it down.  Gone/cleaned up within 2 minutes or less!"
A23CIZQS0Q3K93	5	Spoiled chihuahua loves it!!!	0	0	I started feeding this when my vet told me to stop giving him his beloved cat food.  It is the only dog food that he will eat.  He has now achieved normal weight, is very healthy and very active.  Great stuff!!!!!
AS6349P9CX7TU	4	All 5 dogs give it a thumbs up !!	0	0	Feeding 5 shih tzus can sometimes be difficult but this variety pack keeps them happy and looking forward to dinner.<br />The stackable trays keep everything clean in the cupboard and the tops are very easy to open.
ACHFM2AEXW69R	3	Okay...	0	0	It is okay. I bought it for my Maltese-Shih Tzu mix and he loves it. My other dog is a Beagle and he loves them too and gets jealous of my Maltese mix. The only thing I don't like about the product, is that you have to feed 4 little packs a day per 10 lb dog. The box I have is a 24 pack so you have to have to buy a big box every week.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like about this is there are a lot of by products in the food.
A2XOTNYF08AFZ9	2	Look closely	2	4	My now 6 year old Chihuahua ate Cesar dog food for quite a while and seemed to really like it. But I got so tired of picking out BIG blood vessels that I couldn't stand to feed it to her anymore. The listed ingredients didn't help either so I switched to a healthier brand of dog food. I just couldn't get over those blood vessels and it is quite pricey for such a little can, especially not having better ingredients.

A3PCEG8ZMW93DN	1	Cesar dog food	0	2	My dog won't eat it.  He tips his bowl upside down on the floor if I serve it to his little Highness. He is a Maltese, about 8 lbs.  As of now, Feb. 24, 2012, I paid a dollar pack for it at my local super market. I don't like having to clean my dollars off the floor!
A3SEW1ECTN5D0D	1	Dog loved it Vet hates it	1	4	Feeding this every day made my dog sick accoding to the vet.  I had to throw my 1 year old yorkie's stockpile away.
A1IZSHPEB6EQKP	1	Not good for your dog	1	4	Do your research of the ingredients before you buy this for your dog to eat. Would you feel safe about feeding this to your dogs I wouldn't. Just cause it has a fancy packaging doesn't mean that it's any good.
A3KAQ5O0Z27ATX	1	WAY TOO EXPENSIVE !!!!	1	4	My little rat terrier will only eat Little Cesar--- For the last 5 years I have bought these small cups of food.<br />I pay at my local grocer .68 per carton..... The 12 pack boxes are always 7.99....<br />This deal makes them nearly $ 1.00 per carton.<br /><br />wish it would be 48 cartons--- then it would be a great deal but not for 12.<br /><br />NO THANK YOU !!!
A3SEW1ECTN5D0D	1	Dog loved it Vet hates it	0	3	The vet beleives that giving my dog this food every day made him sick. (1 year old, 12 pound yorkie) but he loves it. I have to give away the stockpile I had.
