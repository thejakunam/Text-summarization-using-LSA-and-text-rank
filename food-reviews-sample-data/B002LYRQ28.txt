AUI3US13YHN93	5	My Picky, Picky, PICKY Dog Loves Chewnola	0	0	I have small-medium size Schipperke/Chihuahua who's ultra picky with his food and treats.  The first time I bought Chewnola was at a store and it was the only bone-like treat they had.  Despite the dog's pickiness, I bought a pack out of sheer desperation.  He's been crazy about these Chewnola bones since day one.  My dog isn't just picky, he's a hyper-active, major chewer with razor-like teeth in the front who bores easily.  One Chewnola keeps him completely occupied for hours, mopre than any other type of bone I've given him.  One of my cats seems to enjoy the taste and he takes the treat from the dog.  The cat will lick it until it's taken back by the dog (I do have a video of that).  I highly recommend Chewnola to anyone with any type of dog, especially picky ones.  Some 411 - I order these from Amazon because, even with shipping, I save a lot of money on this item - in the store it cost double.
A2AMSFMUWXREZZ	5	My dog's favorite!!!	0	0	We saw these at the store, and decided to try them for our mini Aussie. She LOVES them! They're rolls of rawhide filled with peanut butter, with granola on the outside, and she will spend hours chewing on them. The only thing I would warn anyone about is they can be quite messy. She makes a mess on herself AND the floor, so be prepared for that, but I definitely would recommend them as a healthy chewable treat that cleans their teeth :)
