A3PI8JJ2E4VT5E	5	yummy rice the best.  beats regular rice for taste	25	25	This black rice is the most incredible tasting rice I have ever eaten.  I just love it.  I now use it instead of brown rice.  It just adds a zing to the taste buds that you'd never expect from rice.  I use it with my black beans so it is used a lot.  If you try this rice you'll probably not go back to traditional brown rice.  It is yummy.
A1FSSSG3YKGA0J	5	Tasty and different!	11	11	"I have been reading about the nutritional benefits of Black Rice and was happy to have found it on Amazon.com.  The rice can be used anywhere you would use white or brown rice.  I boiled it, drained and sauteed it in a little Extra Virgin Olive Oil, minced fresh garlic, minced fresh parsley and salt and pepper.  Its really, really savory.  Not bland at all.  I'm looking forward to trying it with stir fry.<br />My only ""issue"" is that the package doesn't include great instructions.  The best thing to do is to add the rice to boiling water and boil for about 18 minutes and drain.  It is parboiled, so it doesn't need to simmer for as long as regular rice does.<br />Also, it doesn't seem to ""expand"" as much as white or brown rice do.  That's not a complaint...just an observation.<br />I'm really happy with my purchase and expect to buy it again.<br />Its great to be able to try new products and to get them at a reasonable price."
AX7H4ZTOAKB00	5	Aromatic, beautiful, and tasty	4	4	Several years ago I would buy this product at Trader Joe's. They no longer carry it. Since then, I've been looking around for it locally. I live in a populated area, so one would think it would be in stores locally. It isn't, or at least I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />TASTE/TEXTURE:<br />This rice tastes wonderful, and presents beautifully on a white plate. The black color really pops out. The shape is slightly thick and short grain. It has a floral aromatic quality and an excellent, hearty, slightly chewy texture. My brain associates dark colored rice to have an earthy character, like wild rice, but this rice is quite the opposite. It would compliment sweet/spicy stir-fry dishes, fish and anything else you would prefer a more floral type of rice for.<br /><br />FEEDBACK:<br />Everyone I have ever served it to loves this rice (and asks where I bought it). I wish this rice came in larger size quantities at a cheaper price so that I could use it more often.<br /><br />PREPARATION:<br />I use about the same amount of water that I use for brown rice in my rice cooker, and I put it on the brown rice setting. I've used a white rice setting before and it turned out fine, but a little more chewy than I preferred.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE:<br />From what I've read, this rice has its origins in China, but today is cultivated in Italy.
A19Q6EHPUDOMBE	1	Nuitrition not included.	2	2	"I purchased this thinking ""the Italians are good with food, this should be delicious.""  If you know anything about food, it looses its nutrition the more it's cooked.  This product comes pre-cooked, par-boiled.  Black rice is a rich, nutty, food that is so filling it's like a whole meal.  Foodies love it because it balance out the usual plate of protein, vegetables, and starch with flavorful starch.  It can be eaten alone, with milk as a breakfast, with beans in the forest or as a centerpiece of exotic meal.<br />However, the reason we love this stuff is because it's high in vitamins.  Not this stuff.  Par-boiling then drying it out destroys much of the vitamins and flavor.<br /><br />Stay far, far away if you want vitamins and flavor."
A37MIEUN6MOWI6	5	great black rice...	2	2	This is the best black rice that i have tried...It is nutty tasting and chewy...very good...It is parboiled so it only takes about 18 minutes to cook...
A3GVHT2KL4L2RL	5	Black Rice	2	2	Incredibly good tasting rice.  If you use a rice cooker it will take and extra 1/3 cup water and cooks a little longer.  It only has a 6 week shelf life, didn't know why a rice would only have a 6 week shelf life.
A1YR9UWPUZE5N3	5	Delicious	1	1	I steamed the black rice. In a separate pan in fried onions, peppers, eggplant and garlic. Finished it with pomegranate balsamic reduction and served it over the black rice. It was great!
A2P4BTBY1LAWI5	5	Rice eating family	1	1	My family likes to eat healthy & we watch the aomount we eat. What we miss is pasta, potatoes & all the good starchy foods, but rice is good & heathy for you so when we find a interesting& healthy food of course we want to try it. I read that black rice helps prevent breast cancer & that made it more appealing to me so while ordering other items from Amazon I orderd the Riso Bello Venere. We cooked it the night I received it & the smell & flavor was so good. It actually makes more or the grains are bigger than regular rices. I have served it with fish & beef & it is good with both. To bad it is expensive but I will continue to order it when I place an order with Amazon.

ABANUQXRYEP3R	5	Fantastic rice	1	1	This rice looks a little funny when cooked but you cannot beat the flavor. Smells great too. After reading about the health benefits of black rice, I purchased in hopes of adding better foods to my toddlers diet. Turns out the whole family loves it. I added to the subscibe and save because it is so flavorul and easy to make.
A1P7JJ35GOHHIP	5	Love it!!! Good carbs for good diet!	0	0	"I was getting ready for a figure competition when one of my acquaintances, who is a personal trainer also, told me about this rice. I found it and I love it. So does my husband. I use my rice cooker for it - no worries about boiled water running over all stove (this is how I usually cook rice :)). Before I start cooking I wash it, add garlic salt and olive oil. When it's ready - it is delicious!!!<br />It does look interesting when it's ready. My co-workers still can't stop thinking that I am eating mice drops :). Or I eat bugs and worms.<br />Even it is called ""Black rice"" the color is very dark purple. When you wash it you will see dark water comes from a pot.<br />I also use it for my salads to give it a little color and taste.<br />If you want to use it for a soup - I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't care if it turns in black color.<br /><br />By the way, if you use a rice cooker - cook it on ""white rice"" settings."

A4KAEANZM2SHK	5	The nuttiest!	0	0	While in Vancouver, I tried black rice. It was a first.  This is comparable as to delicious robust flavor with a nutty taste and texture. I hightly endorse it.
